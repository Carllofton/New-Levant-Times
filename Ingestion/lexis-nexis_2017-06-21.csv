1,The Washington Post,2010-12-04,"Syria's renewed influence raises alarms in U.S., Israel",Suburban Edition,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,A-SECTION; Pg. A06,"December 4, 2010",1036 words,"Syria's fresh interference in Lebanon and its increasingly sophisticated weapons shipments to Hezbollah have alarmed American officials and prompted Israel's military to consider a strike against a Syrian weapons depot that supplies the Lebanese militia group, U.S. and Israeli officials say. The evidence of a resurgence by Syria and its deepening influence across the region has frustrated U.S. officials who sought to change Syrian behavior. But the Obama administration has so far failed through its policy of engagement to persuade the country to abandon its support for Hezbollah and sever its alliance with Iran. ""Syria's behavior has not met our hopes and expectations over the past 20 months and Syria's actions have not met its international obligations,"" Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told the Lebanese daily an-Nahar on Nov. 10. ""Syria can still choose another path and we hope that it does."" Israel has complained to the United Nations about long-range missiles and shorter-range rockets that are flowing freely from camps inside Syria to a transit site along the Syrian border with Lebanon and on to Hezbollah. But Israel has so far hesitated to take military action out of concern that such a strike could touch off a conflict even bloodier than the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, said an Israeli military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. In the past, U.S. interest in Syria was mostly limited to coaxing it to make peace with Israel and to end its rule in Lebanon. But now it is increasingly clear that Syria - with its pivotal alliance with Iran and its strategic borders with Israel, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq - has the ability to shape regional developments on a broader scale. The Obama administration's efforts at dialogue with Syria have done little to stop the flow of weapons, end Syria's practice of sheltering Palestinian leaders of militant groups, or counter Syria's interference in Lebanon, which has undermined the U.S. effort to promote Lebanese independence from external actors. Although President Obama has named a new ambassador to Syria, his appointment is being held up on Capitol Hill by senators who say they do not want to send a new envoy to Damascus until the United States better articulates how having an ambassador there would help achieve its goals. Without a permanent top diplomat in the Syrian capital, U.S. envoys - including Middle East peace mediator George J. Mitchell, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, Jeffrey D. Feltman, and Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) - have flown to Damascus to try to persuade Syrian leaders to take steps to improve relations with the United States, which hit a low point in 2005. That year, President George W. Bush, in the wake of Saddam Hussein's ouster in Iraq, warned Syria to stop the flow of foreign fighters across its border into Iraq, prompting fears in Damascus of a U.S. effort to topple Syria's leadership. Massive anti-Syrian demonstrations in Beirut forced Syria to withdraw its troops from Lebanon. Syria's relations with regional allies soured. Today, there are clear signs that the country has emerged stronger than before. While the United States maintains sanctions against Syria, American allies such as India and Turkey have inked trade deals with Damascus in recent months that undercut the American effort. Syria plays a role in Iraq. In September, a parade of Iraqi politicians flocked to Damascus seeking advice on forming a government. And Syria's alliance with Iran remains strong, to the dismay of U.S. officials who, as the WikiLeaks cables show, had hoped to drive a wedge between Syria and Iran, in part to stop the flow of weapons to Hezbollah. But Syria's support of Hezbollah remains robust. Israeli surveillance tracks the nighttime missile shipments as Syrian personnel escort them from clandestine bases in Syria to the Lebanese border. At the swap area, the weapons are transferred to Lebanese trucks and driven into southern Lebanon and to Beirut, the Israeli military official said. Asked about the likelihood of Israel striking at the border transfer area or one of the camps inside Syria, the military official said, ""This is definitely one of the options Israel has. Of course any attack like this could lead to an escalation."" Persuading Syria to break its alliance with Hezbollah's chief patron, Iran, would be a key step toward ending the shipments. But it is in Lebanon that Syria's regional resurgence has been felt most profoundly. Hadi Mahfouz, a Lebanese government official and writer, says Syria is more effectively managing Lebanese affairs from afar than when it had 15,000 troops inside the country. Wiam Wahab, a pro-Syrian Druze politician and former Lebanese cabinet minister, says Washington must resolve its differences with Syria if the United States wants to stymie Iran's influence. Many Lebanese, especially those in the Christian and Sunni communities, still oppose any Syrian role in Lebanese affairs. Lebanon's top security positions - the head of military intelligence and director of general security - are controlled by Syrian-approved appointees. The government can't make many major decisions without first consulting with Damascus. Lebanon's top leaders, including Prime Minister Saad Hariri, toe a pro-Syrian line. But the clearest example of Syria's restored influence may be Walid Jumblatt. Five years ago, Jumblatt, a well-known Druze politician whose party holds swing votes in Lebanon's coalition government, marched with the pro-democracy March 14 movement against Syria's occupation. He now describes that period as a momentary lapse of sanity. ""I feel much more comfortable now. I'm back to my roots,"" Jumblatt said last month. Jumblatt credits Syria with reestablishing order after the Lebanese civil war and suggests that Syria's military may need to take over again if Hezbollah is indicted by an international tribunal investigating the killing of former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq al-Hariri and sectarian strife arises. ""It seems that, well, we cannot govern ourselves by ourselves,"" Jumblatt said. ""Lebanon is not a nation. It's a bunch of tribes."" zachariaj@washpost.com"
2,The Nation (Thailand),2010-09-25,Kumar Krishnan,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"September 24, 2010",1157 words,"The Nation After being in the doghouse for almost half a decade, the tide is turning in Syria's favour. Hounded by the Bush administration for its ties with Hezbollah and Iran, ignominiously expelled from Lebanon and mostly shunned by the Arab world, Syria recoiled into a corner, licking its wounds. The winds of change started to blow with the installation of the Obama administration in Washington. Overturning the policy of his predecessor, who withdrew the US ambassador over Syria's alleged role in the assassination of Lebanon's former premier Rafik al-Hariri, Obama sent an ambassador to Damascus in February, in keeping with his policy of engagement. But probably the most significant development came earlier this month. In a stunning, almost self-deprecating about-turn, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri recanted accusations of Syrian involvement in the assassination of his father. In an interview to Saudi daily Ash-sharq al-Awsat, al-Hariri said: ""At some point we made a mistake. At one stage, we accused Syria of assassinating the martyred premier. That was a political accusation, and that accusation is over. There is a UN court that is doing its job and we, for our part, must reassess what happened."" Rafik al-Hariri was killed in a bomb blast in February 2005. In the days leading up to his assassination, a coldness had crept into his relationship with Damascus, which saw him as tilting toward the West. Assassinations are not new to Lebanese politics, but this one created a groundswell of rage against what was widely considered to be a Syrian job. Nearly a million people took to the streets in what became known as the ""Cedar Revolution"". In many ways, the masses seemed to be rising in revolt against years of Syrian overlordship. Syria was ubiquitous by its presence in Lebanon for almost 30 years, and held the key to its stability. Lebanese governments and policies were often made and unmade in Damascus. The Syrian perception, especially among the old guard, was different. Lebanon had been carved out of Greater Syria by the French colonial powers, and this was a bitter development they never came to terms with, which also explains why Syria never had an embassy in Beirut until 2008, despite the fraternal rela tions between the two countries. Amid worldwide condemnation following al-Hariri's assassination, Syria was forced to withdraw its forces from Lebanon. But only the naive would have believed that this marked the end of Syrian influence. In the months that followed, key anti-Syrian politicians were assassinated. A climate of fear pervaded Lebanon. The stage for Syria's diplomatic resurgence was set in 2008 when King Abdullah met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on the sidelines of the Arab summit in Doha. In July this year the Saudi monarch made a goodwill visit to Damascus. Ties between the two countries had been cold after the assassination of al-Hariri, who was patronised by the Saudi rulers. Hitting al-Hariri was tantamount to hitting Saudi Arabia. The Saudis have also been unhappy about Syria's close relations with Iran and Hezbollah. Despite being an important member of the Arab League, the Syrian leadership has often taken positions at odds with the Arab world. When the Arabs were ploughing in billions for Saddam Hussein's flagging war against Iran, Syrian ruler Hafez al-Assad, nurturing a deep distrust of Saddam, backed Iran. But the Saudi reconciliation efforts were guided by more than bilateral interests alone. Syria is critically placed in the region. With the US withdrawing from Iraq, Arabs will bank on Syria, as a neighbouring state, to ensure an emasculated Iraq is not swallowed by Tehran. Syria also has a crucial role to play in the Middle East peace process. The Hamas leadership, which is determined to play spoilsport in peace moves, resides in Syria. Any move for a rapprochement between Fatah, the rulers of the West Bank, and Hamas, the rulers of Gaza, will need their blessings. King Abdullah has tried and failed to reconcile the warring Palestinian factions. Importantly, Lebanon, because of its delicate demography - comprising Shi'ite Muslims, Sunnis, Maronite Christians and the Druze, and a communally minded electorate - is a powder keg. Thirty years ago, Syria was given the role of maintaining peace and stability in Lebanon. This it achieved by not letting any of the disparate factions gain an upper hand. But al-Hariri's about-turn raises a host of questions. What prompted the Lebanese premier to suddenly withdraw the allegation of Syrian involvement in his father's assassination? Was he privy to new facts that absolve Syria, contrary to the interim report issued in 2007 by the UN investigation that indicted Syria as the mastermind? Hezbollah has already unleashed a campaign against the UN tribunal, saying it expected its members to be indicted, and called it an Israeli conspiracy. Is al-Hariri throwing in his lot with Syria as the lesser evil to rein in its surrogate, Hezbollah? Hariri had a tough time forming a government after leading the March 14 Coalition to victory in elections in 2009, but which fell short of a majority. Hezbollah, funded and trained by Iran, has become a law unto itself. In defiance of a UN Security Council Resolution, it continues to retain weapons, warning of mayhem should any Lebanese government move to disarm it. The Future Movement national unity government led by Saad Hariri includes Hezbollah's political wing. If Hezbollah is going to be indicted for the assassination of Lebanon's former prime minister, then it will be difficult to keep alive a coalition led by the slain leader's son. But it is also impossible to form a government without Hezbollah's support. The upcoming report by the UN Tribunal could be a new test for Lebanon's stability. And it was probably out of this realisation that King Abdullah again reached out to Syrian President al-Assad. The two, in a unique gesture, travelled on the same flight to Beirut, calling for calm and restraint by the factions. Was Hariri's about-turn part of a Saudi rehabilitation of Syria aimed at stabilising Lebanon and wooing Syria back into the Arab fold, irrespective of the facts of the assassination? It's hard to believe that al-Hariri, born and brought up in Saudi Arabia, and considered even closer to the Saudi rulers than his late father, would have made such a stunning about-turn without Saudi blessings. Syria's diplomatic plate meanwhile is brimming. President Obama's Middle East envoy George Mitchell has twice visited Damascus in the last four months pledging to build a relationship based on ""mutual respect and mutual interest"". Worried about the diplomatic wooing of Syria, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made a sudden visit on Saturday, en route to Algeria and the UN. At this point, Syria would be content to keep all sides happy and guessing, having unmistakably proved its strategic relevance to the region."

4,The Daily Star (Lebanon),2010-01-12,Turkish-Syrian rapprochement is a key to Mideast peace,,23,Newspaper,,Chris Phillipsguardian.co.uk,ENGLISH,,"July 26, 2010",876 words,"As Henry Kissinger once put it, it is not possible to make peace in the Middle East without Syria. This, among other things, requires engaging Syria and not only by its arch-enemy, Israel. Other countries in the region have to make the Syrian leadership feel more confident of taking bold steps when necessary in highly complicated and multifaceted issues such as the return of the Golan Heights. In recent history, Syria's primary allies were the Soviet Union during the Cold War and Iran since the Islamic Revolution. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, only Iran remains. Lebanon formed the backdrop for Iran and Syria's rivalry with Israel and the United States, but in the aftermath of the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, Syria was forced to withdraw its troops from Lebanon and, by extension, diminish its influence on Lebanese domestic and foreign policy. Since then, the Syrian leadership has seemed more willing to break out of its isolation from the rest of the world. Improved relations with its northern neighbor Turkey, a longstanding member of the Western world with close ties to the Middle East, came right at that point. Constructive approaches by the political leaderships on both sides of the Turkish-Syrian border - which could have been the scene of a bloody war in October 1998 because of Syria's sustained support for the Kurdistan Workers' Party, the PKK, and its terrorism against Turkey - have been one reason for the much improved bilateral relations ever since. Based on the confidence built with the Syrian leadership, and thanks to Turkey's already credible standing in Israeli political circles, Turkey was asked to mediate between Israel and Syria in order to reach a stable peace. Turkey's engagement with Syria on bilateral as well as trilateral platforms helped Syria break its isolation until the recent crisis between Turkey and Israel due to the abrupt cancellation of the participation of Israeli aircraft in military exercises planned for October 2009. Following a bitter exchange between Israeli and Turkish officials, Israel's prime minister and foreign minister, Benjamin Netanyahu and Avigdor Lieberman, declared that Turkey would no longer be considered a mediator with Syria. This may be bad news for those who still care about the strategic value of Turkish-Israeli cooperation and who yearn for the ""good old 1990s"" when Turkey and Israel were jointly strategizing. But, is this really the case? Is Turkey's mediation between Syria and Israel even still needed to overcome the bottlenecks in the negotiations? The short and simple answer is ""no."" The unprecedented rapprochement between Turkey and Syria, which has gained enormous momentum during the last few months, is likely to provide Israel with what was indeed expected from Turkey's mediation anyway. The Golan Heights constitute the major bottleneck in negotiations between Israel and Syria, not because of their military-strategic value, but rather because of the existence of significant water resources in the area, which neither side can neglect. Israel's proposed solution to this problem since the mid-1990s has been to convince Turkey to release more water from the Euphrates River to Syria so as to compensate for what Syria would lose by agreeing to the return of the Golan without the right to use the water resources in the area. Turkey has long resisted the idea on the grounds that a binding agreement with Syria would jeopardize Turkey's future rights to the waters in the Euphrates-Tigris River Basin for its own economic development, especially when during extended dry seasons. But much water passed under the bridge. Turkey and Syria signed over 50 protocols on issues extending from economic to scientific and technological cooperation and trade during the visit of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Syria in the last days of 2009, where he was accompanied by half-a-dozen ministers. The water issue constituted one of the major topics of these protocols. There were some difficulties in reaching a full-fledged agreement on the definitional and technical dimensions of the issue in the area of cooperative uses of the waters in the region, including the Orontes River. However, the parties seem confident that these are not insurmountable problems, given the existence of political will on both sides of the border, now open to the transit of goods and services as well as of citizens of both countries. Against this background, it wouldn't be wrong to argue that, if Turkey provides enough assurances to Syria that it will release more water when needed by its southern neighbor, Ankara will have played the mediating role that was essentially expected from her by Israel. In other words, if Turkey can be effective in relieving Syria's water stress, Syria and Israel can move closer to a resolution of the problems over the Golan Heights, which in turn will bring peace between them much nearer. Whether Netanyahu and Lieberman acknowledge it or not, in some respects the key to a sustainable peace between Israel and Syria lies in Turkey's policy toward Syria. Paradoxically though, one reason why the Israeli leaders make unfortunate statements that reflect their anger with their Turkish counterparts' attitude toward Israel may be because Turkey is delivering anyway what Israel needs the most in this puzzle, but this time without Israel asking for it.

Its political system is weak and outside parties continue to vie for political advantage as part of a larger regional conflict. In particular, Syria and Iran provide support for the militant Islamist group Hizbullah as a strategic asset to pressure Israel. Hizbullah now Editor's note: The following is a report issued by the Center for Preventative Action, part of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), an independent, membership organization, think tank, and publisher concerned with US foreign policy. Daniel C. Kurtzer Introduction Lebanon has been a flashpoint for Arab-Israeli violence and military confrontations since the mid-1970s. Its political system is weak and outside parties continue to vie for political advantage as part of a larger regional conflict. In particular, Syria and Iran provide support for the militant Islamist group Hizbullah as a strategic asset to pressure Israel. Hizbullah now controls most of southern Lebanon, while its political wing has developed a strong presence in the Lebanese Parliament. In July and August 2006, Israel and Hizbullah fought what became known as the ""Second Lebanon War,"" which killed and displaced many thousands of people and destroyed much of Lebanon's infrastructure. Since then, Hizbullah has steadily rearmed in contravention of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which requires, inter alia, ""the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon, so that, pursuant to the Lebanese Cabinet decision of July 27, 2006, there will be no weapons or authority in Lebanon other than that of the Lebanese state,"" and ""no sales or supply of arms and related material to Lebanon except as authorized by its government."" Hizbullah's arsenal is more potent in quantity and quality today than it was in 2006. Although the border area between Israel and Lebanon is quieter than at any time in the previous decade, speculation that a third Lebanon war will occur in the next 12 to 18 months has been steadily rising. Israel could decide that the security threat posed by Hizbullah has reached intolerable levels and take preemptive military action. Hizbullah, while outwardly showing no interest in confronting Israel at this time, may for various reasons choose or be pressured by Iran to flex its new military capabilities. As happened in 2006, even small-scale military engagements with limited objectives can escalate into a major conflict. Whatever the precipitating reasons, a new conflict over Lebanon would have significant implications for US policy and interests in the region. The contingency First, Hizbullah could initiate hostilities. The recent passing of Lebanese Shiite cleric Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, a spiritual adviser to Hizbullah and a man with many enemies inside and outside Lebanon, could spark strife within Lebanon in which Hizbullah could decide to attack Israel as a means of unifying its supporters. Alternatively, the Islamic Republic could push Hizbullah to attack Israel as a means of deflecting international pressure on Iran over its nuclear program. In either case, Hizbullah likely would argue that it was responding to Israeli overflights or an incident on the border that resulted in Lebanese casualties. Hizbullah has so far shown little predisposition to do this - it ignored Israel's recent firing of flares during an incident on the border and it has not reacted to persistent Israeli overflights of Lebanon. Hizbullah-provoked violence would cost it support in the Arab world, as occurred in 2006 and could unify the international community to support Israel's retaliation. But continued Hizbullah restraint cannot be assumed, nor can a miscalculation by Hizbullah, for example, a limited attack that stimulates a major Israeli response, be ruled out. Second, Israel could attack Hizbullah or lure it into a war to destroy capabilities that threaten Israel's security. Israel could also decide to degrade Hizbullah's capabilities in order to deny Iran a ""second-strike"" capability should Israel decide to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Israel could also use a conflict with Hizbullah as the catalyst and cover for an attack against Iran's nuclear facilities. Any of these circumstances could persuade Israel that a preventive military strike against Hizbullah is in its interest. Of the two scenarios, the second is the more likely. Hizbullah has probably already breached the limits of what Israel considers acceptable behavior. The sheer number and enhanced quality of rockets Hizbullah has acquired in the past few years worry Israeli defense and homeland security planners, as does the effort by Hizbullah to acquire longer-range and more accurate surface-to-surface missiles. During the 2006 conflict, about 1 million Israeli civilians were forced to evacuate their homes in northern Israel because of Hizbullah rocket attacks; in a future war, that number would almost certainly rise because of the longer-range and greater accuracy of new Hizbullah weaponry. Israel views Hizbullah's acquisition of Scud missiles (some varieties of which could reach Israeli targets from as far away as northern Lebanon) or the Syrian M-600 rockets (which can carry a 500-pound warhead a distance of 250 kilometers with an advanced guidance system) as a strategic threat. Another Israeli ""red line"" is Hizbullah's acquisition of advanced surface-to-air missiles, such as the S-300, which would reduce Israel's air superiority over Lebanon. Israel views its reconnaissance missions over Lebanon as critical in light of the failure of the international community and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701. It also views as critical its ability to establish aerial dominance in the event of another war. The combination of these three factors - the size and quality of Hizbullah's missile inventory; the possible acquisition of long-range, accurate missiles; and the possible upgrading of Hizbullah's surface-to-air missile capability - changes the equilibrium on the ground to an extent that Israel views as threatening. An Israeli military strike on Hizbullah could unfold in several ways. In the most likely scenario, Israel could exploit what its military planners call an ""operational opportunity,"" that is, an attack against a convoy carrying long-range weapons or against a storage facility in Lebanon. Alternatively, Israel might choose to attack facilities and weapon-storage sites in Syria that it claims Hizbullah is using. The September 2007 strike against a nuclear reactor site in Syria demonstrates that Israel is willing and able to carry out such an attack. Were Israel to attack Hizbullah sites in Syria, Hizbullah could retaliate across the Israel-Lebanon border, thereby precipitating a wider war. Alternatively, Israel could conduct a broader aerial campaign against Hizbullah, hitting targets throughout Lebanon as it did in 2006. Depending on how well this campaign achieved its objectives, it could be followed up with a ground invasion, which would further escalate the conflict. It is unclear whether the recent Israeli assault on the Gaza flotilla and the resulting international pressure on Israel would restrain possible Israeli actions in Lebanon. Israel might now be hesitant to test international reaction. However, there is no evidence of this factor being considered in the Lebanon context, and thus this scenario assumes Israeli decision-making that focuses almost single-mindedly on the Hizbullah and contextual threats. Indicators and warnings The indicators and warning signs of an imminent war are already evident but need to be monitored for qualitative and quantitative changes. These signs include the following: Increase in Hizbullah's anti-Israeli rhetoric. Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general and leader of Hizbullah, gave a fiery speech on June 4 in response to the flotilla incident. Nasrallah attacked Israel in strong terms but stopped well short of threatening retaliation. However, he did warn Israel publicly that attacks against Lebanon would be met with similarly targeted attacks against Israel, indicating that he believes Hizbullah has the capacity to hit such strategic targets. Although Nasrallah admitted in 2006 that Hizbullah would not have started that war had it known of Israel's response, lately he has not shied away from keeping his rhetoric at a high pitch. Increase in Israeli official statements and public commentary about Hizbullah and Iran. In April 2010 Israel charged Syria with transferring Scud missiles to Hizbullah. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later declared that Hizbullah fighters were now operating out of a secret base in Syria where they were training with the Scuds. (Israel apparently has no information indicating that Scuds have actually been delivered to Hizbullah in Lebanon.) Syrian officials have denied all Israeli charges related to Hizbullah. Heightened levels of Israeli military and civil defense preparedness. Since 2006 and the appointment of Lieutenant General Gabi Ashkenazi as Israeli Army chief of staff, the Israeli military has devoted considerable attention to training and practicing to deal with the threat posed by Syria and Hizbullah. Ashkenazi maintains that the Israeli Army is far more prepared today to deliver a stunning blow against Hizbullah. These Israeli preparations serve as much to deter Hizbullah military initiatives as they do to prepare the Israeli Army for war. In February 2010, the Israeli Army exercise ""Firestone 12"" was predicated on the introduction of new weapon systems into Lebanon that would threaten Israel's security, such as long-range missiles and advanced air-defense systems. In addition, the Israeli Army's Homeland Security Branch conducted a large-scale civil defense exercise in May 2010, which, even though an annual event, was played up in the Israeli media as a signal to Hizbullah of Israel's readiness for war. US policy options to reduce the likelihood of the contingency To try to head off renewed fighting between Hizbullah and Israel, the United States could consider one or more of the following options, none of which is simple or assured of success. Deter/reassure Israel. The United States could tell Israel privately at the highest level that it would not support an Israel-initiated war and would withhold diplomatic or military support if Israel chose to attack Hizbullah. Specifically, the United States could threaten to initiate or support a UN Security Council resolution directed against Israel, should Israel start a war. Israel would likely mobilize its supporters in the United States to push back against the administration, and the Obama administration would face a firestorm of pressure from Capitol Hill and the pro-Israel lobby organizations. Adopt preventive diplomatic measures. Consideration can be given to resurrecting in some form the Israel-Lebanon Monitoring Group, which operated for about three years in the late 1990s as a clearinghouse for the parties to defuse tensions and reduce the risk of conflict harming civilians. The presence of an international monitoring body could restore credibility to the effort to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701. The United States could also invigorate its diplomatic responses to local incidents on the border so as to prevent escalation. Pressure Syria. The Obama administration with partners on the UN Security Council, in the EU, and in the Arab world could try to bring international pressure on Syria to prevent the transfer of sophisticated arms to Hizbullah and to shut down the supply line. Syria has responded to pressure in the past (for example, by withdrawing its armed forces from Lebanon after UN Security Council Resolution 1701 was passed). Negotiate with Hizbullah and Lebanese authorities. The Obama administration could use the prospect of renewed violence in Lebanon as a catalyst to engage Hizbullah, directly or through a third party, and try to moderate its behavior. The administration could argue that Hizbullah is now a part of the Lebanese government and that dialogue could become a means of reducing Hizbullah's terrorist activities. This is a difficult option for the United States. The administration would also come under severe political pressure at home, including from Democrats, not to engage Hizbullah. More importantly, there seems little that the US could offer or threaten to do to convince Hizbullah to moderate its terrorist activities. Encourage a limited Israeli military strike. As a means of forestalling a major military operation by Israel, the United States could suggest two preventive and pre-emptive military options: Israeli action against Hizbullah supply lines (whether Scuds are being transported or not) and/or an Israeli strike against Hizbullah training sites in Syria where long-range missiles are being stored. Both options hold out the possibility of engaging Syria in hostilities, especially if Israeli strikes take place on Syrian territory. But both options are limited to military targets, thus minimizing civilian casualties, and both target the exact threats that are causing Israeli concern. US policy options to mitigate the consequences of the contingency The Obama administration would have several options to mitigate those consequences most detrimental to US interests. Condemn and seek to stop Israeli action. In the event that Israel initiates the conflict, the United States could join or sponsor a United Nations Security Council resolution or statement condemning Israel's actions and calling for an immediate ceasefire. In this scenario, the United States could argue that Israel's right of self-defense does not extend to pre-emptive actions against Hizbullah that threaten regional security. The United States could also back up its verbal opposition to Israeli policy with the threat of withholding military supplies needed by Israel to continue fighting. However, this option would be hard for the American administration to justify, both substantively and politically. The United States is already on record criticizing Hizbullah's rearmament, and the domestic backlash against a condemnation of Israel would be severe. Support but seek to restrain Israel's actions. The Obama administration could indicate that Israel's right of self-defense includes the right of preemptive action to deal with Hizbullah's rearmament, such as military strikes against Hizbullah's supply lines and/or attacks against Hizbullah training facilities in Syria. At the same time, the United States could send private and public signals to Israel to confine its military ambitions to the immediate issues at hand. Support Israel unconditionally and condemn Hizbullah, Syria, and/or Iran. The United States could use a military flare-up in Lebanon to mobilize diplomatic opposition to Hizbullah, Syrian, and Iranian behavior. The United States could point to the continued violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 by these parties and the introduction of weapon systems in Lebanon that have destabilized the situation. In this scenario, the United States would seek to delay United Nations Security Council consideration of a ceasefire resolution until top Israeli military objectives had been secured. Envelop the crisis in a broader diplomatic initiative. Under any of these options, the United States could consider exploiting the crisis to launch a broader diplomatic initiative, such as unveiling a US plan on the Israeli-Palestinian track of negotiations or attempt to launch Israeli-Syrian talks. Important Arab states - as well as France and other European countries traditionally interested in Lebanese affairs - would be consulted closely by the United States throughout the crisis. All of these options require US decisions in the hours and first days after the outbreak of war. This is the optimal time for the United States to try to shape the duration and scope of Israel's military actions. First, Israel will want the United States to provide the diplomatic ""space"" and time to accomplish its goals. Second, Israel may require military resupply, especially if aerial operations go on for some time, giving the United States significant leverage. The most critical decision during this period will be how Israel defines its war objectives. Specifically, will its goal be to destroy Hizbullah, degrade its capabilities, or inflict significant damage on Lebanese infrastructure as a means of bringing home to the Lebanese public the danger of continued activity by Hizbullah? The United States would oppose an Israeli strategy of punishing the Lebanese people, and it is difficult to conceive of a scenario in which the United States would align itself with an Israeli goal of trying to destroy Hizbullah: Israel failed in 2006, and is unlikely to have enough time and energy to be more successful in another war. This argues for US efforts to limit Israel's war ambitions, recognizing that periodic wars in Lebanon may be inevitable to deal with continued Hizbullah threats in the future. The experience in the first and second Lebanon wars indicates that the longer the fighting goes on, the greater the likelihood that Israeli military actions will result in mass civilian casualties and substantial destruction of civilian infrastructure. The United States cannot reduce the chances of this happening, since Hizbullah operates from civilian areas. Indeed, in the next war, the civilian battlefield is likely to widen, as Hizbullah has been digging in north of the Litani River. Israeli attacks against targets in civilian areas, however restrained and pinpointed, complicate US efforts to provide Israel with the time necessary to complete its military mission. Not only will the Arab street erupt following reports of civilian casualties, but European public opinion may force US allies to distance themselves from Israel's actions. The likelihood of this scenario has increased as a result of the international firestorm of criticism of Israel's assault in late May 2010 on the Gaza flotilla. Finally, history shows that Israel will not be the first to propose a cease-fire, but will need to be prodded into accepting one. Should the United States seek an early cease-fire, it will face a recurring Israeli paradox. On the one hand, early success on the battlefield increases Israel's interest in administering a more severe blow to the enemy, and Israeli war aims - even if limited at the outset - tend to expand if an opening exists for inflicting a more significant defeat against the enemy. On the other hand, early failures on the battlefield impel Israel to extend hostilities so as to turn the tide of battle. Thus, both success and failure tend to drive Israeli military action toward enlarging war aims and extending combat operations. One of the main roles of the United States, therefore, will be to assess the best time for a ceasefire and then make the case persuasively with the Israelis. Recommendations The United States should work to avert another war in Lebanon, though its capacity to do so is limited. Israel's security is increasingly threatened by Hizbullah's rearmament, and the United States must respect its legitimate right of self-defense. Preventive diplomacy is constrained because of the absence of relations between the United States and the Islamic Republic and Hizbullah, and the poor state of relations between the United States and Syria. The Lebanese government and the Lebanese Armed Forces are essentially non-players in this unfolding drama. Given these circumstances, the US should do the following: Upgrade US intelligence collection and analysis and US-Israel intelligence exchanges. US intelligence assets should be redirected to ensure that US policymakers have the best information available at the time of a crisis. Also, US-Israel intelligence exchanges on Syria, Lebanon, and Hizbullah ought to be intensified now to reconcile possible differences of view and to fill in gaps. Publicly restate US support for Israel's right of self-defense and US concerns about Hizbullah's rearmament. Israel has legitimate security concerns about Hizbullah and Syrian/Iranian activities in Lebanon, and the United States should be clear that it understands Israel's position. The continued failure of the international community to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701 ought to be stressed. This message should be designed to deter Hizbullah from acting, as well as to assure Israel of its security needs. Resurrect an international monitoring effort and invigorate US diplomatic responsiveness. There is little cost and possibly large gain in resurrecting an international monitoring mission. Such a mechanism would lend credibility to the stalled efforts to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701; and it just might provide a forum to work through local incidents before they escalate. At the same time, the United States should empower its embassies in Israel, Lebanon, and Syria to intervene immediately and at the highest level to forestall escalation arising from incidents on the border. Increase diplomatic pressure on Syria. The US should mobilize diplomatic pressure on Syria to desist from providing Hizbullah access to destabilizing weapons. Arab states and France, in particular, can be helpful to US interests if the United States has a sense of what it wants to accomplish and a willingness to bring others into its diplomatic game plan. If such diplomatic pressure fails, the United States should go public with appropriate intelligence information and consult in New York on a Security Council resolution that mandates preventive action against Syria; such a resolution is unlikely to be adopted, but the diplomacy surrounding the New York talks will send a tough message to Damascus. Prepare for the likelihood of a war. Should hostilities break out, the United States should seek an outcome of hostilities that weakens Hizbullah and opens the door for international action to enforce UN Security Council Resolution 1701. Prepare for possible postwar diplomatic initiatives. The Obama administration should study now, on a contingency basis, the possibility of exploiting hostilities in Lebanon to launch a diplomatic initiative in the broader peace process. Providing leadership that reduces the time and scope of hostilities will translate into US diplomatic capital to advance peace talks. 6 of 266 DOCUMENTS Guardian.com July 25, 2010 Sunday Syria and the west: another wasted decade Chris Phillips: Ten years of bullying has failed. If the west wants a more peaceful, democratic Middle East it must be friendlier to Syria As Bashar al-Assad as president of Syria earlier this month, Human Rights Watch marked the occasion with a on the continued human rights abuses and anti-democratic nature of his regime. The report describes Assad's reign thus-far as a ""wasted decade"", with the 44-year-old eye doctor disappointing many by entrenching authoritarian rule rather than promoting greater political openness. While these domestic failures should not be excused, they should not be viewed in isolation since they are closely related to the other major disappointment of Bashar's first decade in power: Syria's bumpy relationship with the west. External threats have long provided the Ba'ath regime with a pretext for repression at home, and the past decade has seen no shortage of those. The invasions of Iraq in 2003 and Lebanon in 2006, followed by sectarian violence in both, as well as on Syrian territory by Israel in 2007 have provided Assad with an arsenal of evidence to support his regime's claim that it provides citizens with stability and safety in a rough neighbourhood. Islamists, intellectuals and political dissidents are often arrested on charges of ""weakening national sentiment"" and other threats to this coveted stability. While Human Rights Watch correctly highlights that ""a review of Syria's record shows a consistent policy of repressing dissent regardless of international or regional pressures"", repression is still justified by the regime as part of a wider nationalist narrative of Syria constantly under threat from Israel, the US and its allies. Western behaviour towards Syria in the past decade has only exacerbated this view. Despite initial between Washington and Damascus after 9/11, Syria's opposition to the Iraq war placed it on a collision course with the Bush administration. With economic sanctions following, the withdrawal of the US ambassador from Damascus after the Hariri assassination in 2005, a cross-border raid by American marines in 2008 and the White House actually in 2007-8, it was not difficult to paint the Bush administration as a genuine national threat. While relations have warmed a little under Obama, and, though the White House has named a new ambassador, the Senate has thus far . Despite Obama's initial positive rhetoric, from the Syrian perspective the new president's inability to stand up to pro-Israeli elements on Capitol Hill and his inertia on the Israeli-Arab peace process means little has changed. While the US is no longer the immediate enemy it was under Bush, Obama shows no sign of being able to restrain the hawkish Israeli government of Binyamin Netanyahu and Avigdor Lieberman, whose have further served to justify Syria's tight security regime. The EU's approach to Syria has done little to balance the US's confrontational stance in the past decade. Though European states resisted Bush's request to implement their own economic sanctions on Syria, they did join in a diplomatic boycott for several years after Assad's withdrawal from Lebanon in 2005, and suspended Syria's accession to the Euro-Med Partnership (EMP) in 2004. Although the boycott was by French president Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, and an EMP Association Agreement was revived the following year, Syria seems not wholly convinced of European intentions. EU members seem to hold Syria to a higher standard than they do its neighbours. Britain and France inserted a line in the 2004 draft Association Agreement requiring Syria to renounce weapons of mass destruction - a condition they had not demanded of Israel when it joined the EMP in 2000. Though this clause was eventually removed in the 2009 version, a new human rights """" was added, not required of other EMP members with similarly poor records such as Egypt, Jordan and Tunisia. Not surprisingly, Syria of this new agreement and has yet to sign it. Syria therefore feels unfairly victimised by the west and Assad is likely to continue to exploit this to bolster his domestic support while simultaneously justifying curbed freedoms. Having survived the Bush onslaught, Assad is visibly : securing his position at home and reaching out for new allies abroad (notably his to Erdogan's Turkey). The US and EU, in contrast, look weak and less and less able to influence the region as they focus on internal problems. The question for these western states is whether their antagonistic approach towards Syria has achieved any of the US and EU's professed goals. After a decade of dithering, the region is no more stable, Israel is no safer and Syria no more democratic or free than it was when Bashar took over in 2000. The last 10 years have shown that none of these aims can be achieved by bullying, threatening or ignoring Syria. Full engagement on an equal footing would seem the best way to avoid wasting another decade."
7,The Jerusalem Post,2010-03-17,New US envoy to Syria outlines concerns,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,NEWS; Pg. 2,"March 21, 2010",584 words,"WASHINGTON - Robert Ford told US senators at a confirmation hearing Tuesday on his nomination as the next US ambassador to Syria that the US would not relax sanctions on Damascus as long as the government continues to support Islamic militant groups. Scrapping the sanctions is one of Syria's top priorities, but Ford made clear such a move wasn't currently in the cards, even as America reaches out to Damascus by returning an ambassador after a gap of five years. ""We will maintain sanctions on Syria as long as it supports terrorist groups like Hizbullah and Hamas,"" he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He also argued that directly conveying America's perspective to Syria was important to advancing US interests, and said, ""Unfiltered straight talk with the Syrian government will be my mission priority."" He then enumerated a number of issues he would be addressing with the Syrian regime upon confirmation, including its relations with Iran, Lebanese sovereignty and the importance of restarting peace talks with Israel. Indirect discussions were held under the auspices of Turkey until Syrian President Basher Assad called them off during the start of Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza last winter. US Senator Chris Dodd (D-Connecticut) suggested that talks with Syria could bear more fruit than the current stalled negotiations with the Palestinians. ""That avenue may offer more promise, at least initially here, than the relationships between the Israelis and the Palestinians,"" he told Ford. Ford himself pointed to significant progress during the Turkey-mediated process. ""My understanding is that the indirect discussions between Syria and Israel in 2008, conducted through Turkish mediation, made considerable headway,"" he said. He added that Israelis needed a clearer picture of how committed Syria was to a different regional framework. Israel has insisted that the Syrians must break ties with Iran and Hizbullah as part of a move towards peace with the Jewish state - steps the US would like to see as well - but Syria has refused the demand. ""The Israelis want to carefully understand the Syrian commitment to what a peace agreement means, in terms of normal relations and Syria's role in the broader regional stability question, and that is a fair question,"" Ford said. ""It is important therefore that we find a formula to get the Israelis and the Syrians back to these negotiations so that we can see how far the Syrian government is willing to go."" The committee chairman, John Kerry, cautioned against raised expectations. ""All of us should be realistic about what engagement can accomplish,"" he said at the beginning of the hearing. ""A Syrian realignment won't come quickly or easily."" Critics of the return of an ambassador to Syria have argued that the move is a reward Syria doesn't deserve, after showing little regard for American interests. A handful of senators have said they would oppose the nomination, but the appointment is expected to be approved. Ford, a former US ambassador to Algeria and most recently the deputy chief of mission in Iraq, defended the approach of having an American envoy in the country. ""Returning an ambassador to Syria would not be a reward to Syria. Nor would it mark a change in the fundamentals of our concerns with that important country. Rather, it would mark a change in the way we try to secure our national interests in Syria,"" he argued. ""Returning an ambassador would mark a change in how we try to persuade, how we try to press Syria."""
8,Guardian.com,2010-02-17,Syria's Assad: pariah to power-broker,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"February 17, 2010",1035 words,"Chris Phillips: It's a remarkable recovery in political and economic fortune that sees Syria and Assad being courted by the west and Arabs alike Washington's decision to this week represents a remarkable turnaround for Syria's Bashar al-Assad. Five years ago, President Assad to announce his army's withdrawal from Lebanon. Greeted by rapturous applause in Beirut and nervous surprise in Damascus, the optometrist who had inherited power barely five years before undid in one speech what had taken his father 24 years to secure: domination over Syria's western neighbour. Western, UN, Arab and popular Lebanese pressure and within six weeks of the and prompted the crisis, Syrian troops were gone and Assad looked vulnerable. . As Beirutis last weekend commemorated the , much has changed. In Lebanon, Syria's allies dominate, giving Damascus compliance without the need for troops. In the Arab world, the various leaders have one by one ended their cold war with Damascus, notably who effectively endorsed Syria's renewed dominance in Lebanon last October. Internationally, the EU have finally offered Syria the , and Obama's new ambassador and diplomatic mission this week represents a renewed engagement from the White House, which many hope will end the mistrust and sanctions of the Bush era. Far from being a pariah, Assad is now courted by the west and Arabs alike as potential power-broker in their disputes with Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas. Fuelled by Syria's surprising recent economic resurgence, its flourishing new alliance with Turkey, Assad's regime security and Arab-wide popularity, the younger Assad is swiftly earning a that eclipses even that of his revered father, . How has Assad achieved this sudden turnaround in fortunes? On the one hand, even at the height of crisis in 2005, the threat to Assad's internal power in Syria was exaggerated. While , Iraq's insurgency was already bogging down American hopes of militarily transforming the Middle East. Such hopes were finally scuppered by Israel's failure to defeat Hezbollah in 2006. Similarly, though congressmen passed sanctions on the Ba'ath regime, they lacked the teeth to topple the government. At the same time, the domestic opposition in Syria remained weak and, though a government in exile was formed by an , they lacked any significant internal support. That said, Assad took no chances and demonstrated unexpected political fortitude within months of the Lebanon withdrawal to consolidate his rule. Most of his father's cronies, the ""Old Guard"" who helped engineer Bashar into power, found themselves honourably retired and replaced by a ""New Guard"" of technocrats and loyalists after the . Many of these new figures, such as foreign minister Walid al-Muallim and deputy prime minister for economic affairs Ali al-Dardari, have been instrumental in the diplomatic and economic successes that have enabled Syria's swift recovery. More challenging than maintaining power at home was ending Syria's international isolation, and Assad again surprised sceptics with his diplomatic skill. He drew closer to fellow outcast Iran, while opportunistically wooing other regional players. He rapidly endorsed to consolidate a burgeoning alliance with Ankara and was quick to , securing much-needed defence supplies in the process. Vital support and investment was also sought from Qatar, culminating in its mediating the 2008 that paved the way for a return to Syrian dominance. Assad's successful cultivation of these allies ensured the failure of the Washington-led diplomatic boycott and, alongside Bush's failures in Iraq and instability in Lebanon, prompted the gradual realisation by Europe, the ""moderate"" Arabs and finally the US that Syria could not be sidelined. Assad's liberalising economic policies have also reaped rewards, with Syria's unexpected . New trade from Turkey, Iraq and the EU has eased fears that economic demands would force Syria to compromise with the US and Israel. Instead, western investors are flocking to Syria, and even the tourist industry is expanding, with Damascus recently named by the . Not surprisingly, Assad's domestic popularity is enhanced by the developing middle class, who credit their president for this economic success. This popularity is mirrored in the wider Arab world, where Assad was in a 2009 Zogby poll. This further boosts Damascus's regional clout, already vying with Egypt and Lebanon for cultural dominance over the Arab world following the widespread popularity of the which further projects a positive view of Syria into Arab living rooms. While sharing his father's unwillingness to bend to US pressure and, perhaps less ruthlessly, stifling of opposition at home, Assad has shown himself to be a different kind of leader. Since the Lebanon withdrawal he has demonstrated opportunism when backed into a corner and a sound reading of the international climate. After the initial disaster of 2005, Assad was quick to adapt the hard power exercised over Beirut by Hafez into the soft power and indirect influence that has seen Syrian dominance in Lebanon return. As the US ambassador's residence in Damascus is once again inhabited, its occupier will find himself dealing with a more confident and influential Syrian president than the one his predecessor left behind in 2005."
9,Dar Al Hayat (Lebanon),2010-03-26,New and Old in Assad's Positions,International Edition,20,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"March 26, 2010",925 words,"In his television interview two days ago, Syrian President Bashar Assad tackled various directions. His comments demonstrated the old and well-known of these stances, but also contained new items. At the least, there was the tone he used to describe political transformations that have appeared in Syrian foreign policy for more than a year, to keep pace with Arab and international changes. Not the least of these new aspects in policy orientations is the Syrians' differentiation between the Barack Obama administration in the United States and the previous White House team. The Syrians were determined to deal extremely diplomatically with the statements by the new US ambassador to Syria, Steven Ford, when commenting on the latter's statements in testimony before Congress. There, Ford talked about disputes and conflicts between Washington and Damascus. The Syrian president has been looking forward to an improvement in relations with the Obama administration, which appears even more imminent with every round of dialogue between the two sides since Obama's election. It is clear that the Syrian leadership is wagering on a resumption of the relationship with the US, ""the biggest power in the world to guarantee the peace process."" Another new item in policy, from Assad's remarks, involved stances such as insisting on the survival of the Arab Peace Initiative, and a revelation about the stance of Syria's chief ally, Iran. Assad commented that he did not hear "" even once from any official over three decades that they were against a peace"" (with Israel), and affirmed that ""if there is a problem with Iraq related to foreign powers (Iran's violation of national security in Iraq), it is first of all due to the Arabs' absence... we are absent, and we should step up and play a role in Iraq."" There might be innovation in Assad's tone toward Iraq and the Iranian role, which should be highlighted, in light of the Iraqi general elections, which produced new results, and after indications that the most topic of accord between Syria and Saudi Arabia, which has evolved step by step since a reconciliation at the end of 2008, is the achievement of true partnership in Iraq's political system, which limits Iran's influence and recovers the clout of the Arab role in the Iraqi domestic equation. It is obvious that the cooperation between Riyadh and Damascus on Iraq is a priority on the two countries' long agenda, in light of domestic and external political movement in the direction of filling the vacuum of a US withdrawal in 2011. If Iran has succeeded in filling the Arab vacuum, in the light of the US occupation in place, and while ethnic, sectarian and religious contradictions in Iraq grow larger, then the long-term Syrian interests of its relationship with a pivotal country and its huge capacities have imposed, in recent years, a contradiction with Iranian policy, under the ceiling of the alliance between Damascus and Iran. Clearly, Saudi-Syrian cooperation picked the opportune moment, which is summed up by domestic Iraqi discontent with America's management of the country's affairs and its division of influence with Iran, in addition to the latter's intervention in Iraqi domestic affairs, the gathering of Iraqi political groups opposed to sectarian conflict among the Shiites, and their alliance with Sunnis and others - all of these being factors that produced a new electoral result, so that the winner may play a role in creating a new partnership in the political system. This Iraqi ""moment"" allows Saudi-Syrian cooperation to achieve a change in the regional picture. This will allow Riyadh to see a limitation of Tehran's influence, which has been increasingly worrying, and serve as a test for how much Damascus can stand apart from its ally. This distance between Syria and Iran is in the interest of regaining Arab initiative, and proves that returning Syria to the Arab fold helps achieve benefits for the Arabs and removes their being described as part of the Iranian axis. Without deluding ourselves about the possibility of splitting Iran from Syria, the awaited post-election political settlement in Iraq resembles that produced by Lebanon's Doha Accord. It shall lead to a government of national unity, in which Iran and other regional powers divide shares of influence, instead of being the dominant factor. Iraq's political settlement will come as a result of cooperation between Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Syria, with Ankara and Damascus taking on the task of ""convincing"" Iran of the plan. If the new in President Assad's comments appeared in his desire to work for multi-faceted partnership in Iraq, with other influential countries, then the old in the stances he announced two days ago was reflected in what he said about Lebanon, when he denied that opponents of Syrian policy in recent years had achieved their announced goals (a Syrian withdrawal, the exchange of ambassadors, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, etc.) If Damascus is moving toward some partnership with regional powers in Iraq, then its position on Lebanon paves the way toward abolishing partnership with these forces in Lebanon, exactly in the fashion it used to manage the country prior to 2005. Will regional powers, which sponsored or took part in the changes that have taken place in this small country, accept seeing their role eliminated, in exchange for Syria's partnership with them in Iraq? Most likely not, despite their determination to take Syria's interests in Lebanon into account in their calculations."

The situation in Lebanon is outside this framework because the tribunal is an internal Lebanese affair. [Kan'an] Thank you Mr Sawwan. Source: Al-Arabiya TV, Dubai, in Arabic 1810 gmt 27 Sep 10"
12,The Daily Star (Lebanon),2010-06-24,French MPs urge Paris to link Syria ties to its progress on Lebanon relations,,23,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"November 4, 2010",1033 words,"The French Parliament's Foreign Affairs committee headed by lawmakers Elisabeth Guigou from the Socialist party and Renaud Muselier from the Union for a Popular Movement recently issued a report assessing French-Syrian ties in the past four years. Excerpts of the report were published in Arabic on Wednesday in Lebanon's As-Safir newspaper. France and Syria's tied suffered terribly following the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who was a personal friend of President Jaques Chirac. The attack was widely blamed on Syria who denied any responsibility, though Damascus denies involvement. However, a warming of ties took place following the election of Nicholas Sarkozy in 2007. In their report, Guigou and Muselier said diplomatic ties ought to be tied to the extent to which Syria was willing to cooperate on certain crucial issues. The report said ever since the Syrian-French ties were revived in 2007, cooperation between the two countries on the political level ""only witnessed a limited development especially when it comes to border demarcation with Lebanon and the issue of the Lebanese detained and missing in Syria."" ""France should not accept this. Damascus expects a lot from Paris and we should only help based on progress made on key issues,"" the French lawmakers wrote in the report. As-Safir said that while Guigou and Muselier presented their view on the state of ties between their country and Syria, their recommendations work as a precursor to what France's diplomatic policy will look like in the upcoming months. The report said France's demand to demarcate the Lebanese-Syrian borders was tied to a need to establish a ""regional security net"" that includes Israel. ""Resolving border problems is crucial to enhance regional security and combat the smuggling of weapons, which Syria uses to control Hizbullah,"" the report said. The lawmakers also accused Syria of working as a ""weapons cache"" for Hizbullah and a haven for Hizbullah and Hamas fighters to train and reside. Syria repeatedly denied Israeli allegations that it was supplying Hizbullah with Scud missiles. The report also raised question marks about a February meeting in Damascus that grouped Syrian President Bashar Assad, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hizbullah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. The lawmakers quoted French diplomats as saying that Assad informed them that he wanted to play the role of mediator between Iran and Hizbullah, on the one hand, and the West on the other. They said Assad used the meeting to ""prohibit"" Ahmedinejad and Nasrallah from launching any attacks on Israel. The French report slammed Damascus for failing to appoint experts on the joint Syrian-Lebanese border demarcation committee. In their meeting in Damascus last week, Lebanon and Syria's presidents called for steps to be taken toward fixing their countries' common border as soon as possible. The report also quoted Lebanese President Michel Sleiman as expressing dissatisfaction with the fact that his Syrian counterpart was holding talks with Lebanese party leaders instead of limiting his meetings with Lebanese officials. On Tuesday, Free Patriotic Movement leader Michel Aoun visited Assad in Damascus. Syria and Lebanon established formal diplomatic relations in October 2008, more than 60 years after independence from a French mandate. Syrian troops entered Lebanon during its 1975-90 Civil War and remained there until 2005. - The Daily Star 13 of 266 DOCUMENTS BBC Monitoring Asia Pacific - Political Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring November 4, 2010 Thursday China's top advisor Jia Qinglin meets Syrian president in Damascus 31 Oct Text of report by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News Agency) [By reporters Liao Lei and Gong Zhenxi: ""Jia Qinglin Meets With Syrian President Bashar""] Damascus, 1 Nov (Xinhua) - Jia Qinglin, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], met with Syrian President Bashar [al-Asad] in Damascus on 31 October local time. Jia Qinglin began by conveying cordial greetings and best wishes from Chinese State President Hu Jintao to President Bashar. In return, Bashar asked Jia Qinglin to communicate his cordial greetings to President Hu Jintao. Jia Qinglin said: There is a profound traditional friendship between China and Syria. Since they established diplomatic relations more than half a century ago, in spite of the mercurial international situation, the ties between our two countries have been developing in a healthy and smooth manner all these years. The two sides have consistently afforded understanding and support to each other on issues concerning their respective core interests. The relationship between China and Syria is a paragon of mutual trust, mutual respect, and open and sincere cooperation between developing countries. Jia Qinglin said: In 2004, Your Excellency paid a successful visit to China, which lent a new impetus to the bilateral relations. Political interactions between our two sides have become increasingly close; there have been active exchanges between us at various levels of our governments and political parties; and we have coordinated and cooperated with each other closely on major international and regional issues. Trade and economic cooperation have been developing at an accelerated pace. Pragmatic cooperation between us in various domains has taken on a positive momentum of comprehensive and rapid development. Jia Qinglin stressed: Both China and Syria are developing countries. They shoulder a common mission in defending state sovereignty and national dignity, promoting economic and social development, and safeguarding world peace and common interests. The Chinese side stands ready to work with the Syrian side to keep reinforcing the foundation of bilateral ties and move the friendly cooperation between our two sides ever forward: Firstly, we shall have even closer political interactions and deepen our mutual trust. We shall strengthen friendly exchanges and cooperation between the political parties and governments of our two countries and exchange, on equal footing, our respective experience in administering our countries and managing state affairs, so that we can learn from each other and achieve common development. Secondly, we shall actively deepen our trade and economic cooperation. We shall strengthen cooperation in the areas of agriculture, infrastructure, investment, and technology and expand the scale of bilateral trade. Thirdly, we shall conduct closer coordination and cooperation in international and regional affairs; jointly push for the establishment of a new international political and economic order that is fair and reasonable; and jointly commit ourselves to the continuous development of China's friendly and cooperative relations with Arab and Islamic countries. Fourthly, we shall encourage friendly exchanges between our two peoples and between the regions in our two countries, keep injecting fresh life force into Sino-Syrian friendship, and help bring about greater development in the ties between our two countries. Bashar said: Since Syria and China established diplomatic relations over half a century ago, bilateral ties have made positive progress on a continuous basis. The important visit that I paid to China in 2004 was of important significance to the furthering of the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries. I am pleased with the positive development of the Syrian-Chinese relations. Bashar said: The Syrian side attaches great importance to its ties with China and stands ready to continuously deepen political mutual trust between the two sides and conduct more extensive and profound exchanges and cooperation across various domains. Bashar reiterated that the Syrian side continues to pursue, in a steadfast man ner, the one-China policy. Bashar also expressed his appreciation of China's peaceful development. He said: China respects other countries and never imposes its will on others and never seeks hegemony. While being committed to its own development, China is also making positive contributions to the cause of world peace and development. We hope China will play an even greater role in international affairs. Qian Yunlu, vice chairman and secretary general of the CPPCC National Committee, Li Huaxin, Chinese ambassador to Syria, and others were present at the meeting. On the same day, Jia Qinglin also gave an interview to the presidents and editors-in-chief of the Syrian Arab News Agency and the Syrian newspaper Al Baath, during which he explained China's position on such issues as Sino-Syrian relations, Sino-Arab relations, and the Middle East issue. On Sino-Arab relations, Jia Qinglin said: The traditional friendship between China and Arab countries goes back a long way. Since more than half a century ago, China and Arab countries have trusted each other at the political level, conducted mutually beneficial cooperation with each other at the economic level, exchanged with and learned from each other at the cultural level, and coordinated and cooperated with each other in international affairs. Their cooperation in various domains has achieved fruitful results. Jia Qinglin pointed out: China always gives firm support to the just cause of Arab countries striving to restore their legitimate national rights and thanks Arab countries for their valuable support on issues that concern China's core interests. China always sees Arab countries as good friends, good brothers, and good partners. We stand ready to coordinate and cooperate with Arab countries to deepen our cooperation in various domains and enable the Sino-Arab strategic cooperative relations to gain fresh headway continuously.

14,The Independent (London),2010-02-18,Obama courts Damascus in hope of ending Middle East deadlock; Assad goes from pariah to ally as US breaks five years of diplomatic isolation for Syria,First Edition,IA,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,WORLD; Pg. 20,"February 18, 2010",734 words,"As Barack Obama moved formally to repair US relations with Syria by nominating an ambassador to serve there after a five-year hiatus, William Burns, America's top career diplomat, held talks in Damascus yesterday with the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad on an array of security issues in the region. The sudden flurry of activity reflects a gamble by Washington that engaging more closely with Syria it can persuade it to take steps on a number of fronts that it sees as being vital to improving stability in the Middle East with regard to all its neighbours - Iran, Iraq, Lebanon as well as Israel. Emerging from his meeting with President Bashar, Mr Burns said the nomination of Robert Ford, a top Arabist at the US State Department, confirmed ""America's readiness to improve relations and to cooperate in the pursuit of [a] just, lasting and comprehensive peace between Arabs and Israelis"". The last American ambassador in Damascus was withdrawn by the Bush administration in 2005 in the wake of the assassination in Beirut of Rafic Hariri, the former Lebanese Prime Minister . Many countries accused Syria of being involved in the attack which killed 22 others but Damascus denied it. Mr Obama campaigned on a promise to renew dialogue with old enemies and Washington was moving even last summer towards restoring an ambassador to Syria. As part of the rapprochement, George Mitchell, Mr Obama's Middle East peace envoy, has also been there at least twice. Newspapers in Damascus reported last week that the country had indicated its approval of a new US ambassador. The nomination of Mr Ford, who is currently the deputy ambassador in Iraq and served as the US ambassador to Algeria from 2006-2008, needs to be approved by the US Senate and there were the first rumblings of dissent yesterday from members of the Republican Party. ""With this nomination, our foreign policy again risks sending the message that it is better to be an intractable enemy than a co-operative, loyal US ally,"" complained Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the top Republican on the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee. The new embrace of Syria is only likely to go so far, however, with suspicions still plain on both sides. The US continues to believe that Syria gives support to Hamas and Hizbollah, two Islamic militant and political groups that Washington continues to categorise as terrorist organisations. Indeed last May, President Obama renewed US sanctions against Syria, accusing it again of supporting terrorism as well as seeking weapons of mass destruction and destabilising peace in Iraq. Mr Burns, who was the quiet architect of the rehabilitation of Colonel Gaddafi of Libya, once himself a prime enemy of the US, admitted that nothing will be easy going forward. ""I have no illusions about the challenges,"" he told reporters. ""But my meeting with President Assad made me hopeful that we can make progress together in the interest of both of our countries."" Talks were also set for later yesterday between Mr Burns and Walid Muallem, the Syrian Foreign Minister. Daniel Benjamin, the State Department's top official on counter-terrorism, was meanwhile scheduled to remain in Syria for meetings with his counterparts. While the anti-US enmity may run deep in Syrian society, the country has reasons of its own to seek an improved level of dialogue. The years of economic sanctions by the US continue to hurt its economy. Meanwhile, the US could assist in persuading Israel finally to hand back the Golan Heights seized in the 1967 war. The Golan remains one of the issues snagging a wider Middle East peace deal. Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, said that if he is confirmed by the Senate, Ambassador Ford will ""engage the Syrian government on how we can enhance relations, while addressing areas of ongoing concern"". In from the cold Sanctions and Syria * May 2004: President George W Bush imposes sanctions on Damascus. The administration cites Syrian support for terrorism and brands the country an ""outpost of tyranny"". * February 2005: Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri is assassinated. Syria is accused of involvement (which it denies) and Washington withdraws ambassador from Damascus. * May 2009: President Obama renews economic and diplomatic sanctions. * February 2010: Obama formally nominates Robert Ford as the new ambassador to Syria and top diplomat William Burns is dispatched to meet President Assad."
15,The Jerusalem Post,2010-04-02,Kerry lauds Assad's commitment to peace-making. Israel dismisses prospect of senator making headway on peace talks with Damascus,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,NEWS; Pg. 2,"April 8, 2010",533 words,"Israeli officials on Thursday dismissed speculation that US Sen. John Kerry will have any luck in Damascus, testing the waters for a Syrian-Israeli diplomatic channel, saying President Bashar Assad's bellicose statement at the recent Arab League summit in Libya belied any peaceful strategy. Assad on Sunday called on Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to ditch negotiations with Israel in favor of ""armed resistance."" Kerry, nonetheless, said in Damascus following a three-hour meeting with Assad that Syria was committed to engaging in peace-making and was essential to the Mideast process. The purpose of Kerry's trip, according to his office, was to assess the prospects for advancing the Arab-Israeli peace process, as well as the political situation in Syria and Lebanon, where he stopped on Wednesday. The Democrat, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters on Thursday that Washington was also concerned about the flow of arms to Hizbullah. ""That is something that must stop in order to promote regional stability and security,"" Kerry said about the weapons. Washington has reached out to Syria in recent months by nominating the first US ambassador to Damascus since 2005 and sending top diplomats to meet with Assad. Washington is hoping to draw Syria away from Iran, Hizbullah and Hamas. ""Syria is an essential player in bringing peace and stability to the region,"" said Kerry, who has long advocated US engagement with Damascus. ""He believes in engagement with Syria, and that through engagement the Syrians can be convinced to play a more helpful role in the Arab-Israeli process,"" a Kerry aide noted. ""This is part of his ongoing [efforts]."" In Israel last month, Kerry discussed Syria's relationship with Iran, saying that ""no one should be surprised, given the relationship of the last years, that discussions are continuing between Syria and Iran."" The two countries are neighbors, he said, ""and they have obviously been pushed somewhat together by the events of the last years. My hope is that we can offer a better alternative, a better set of choices."" Kerry, during that visit which also took him to Jordan and Qatar, spoke by phone with Assad from Amman. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has said on numerous occasions that he was open for negotiations with Assad as long as the Syrians did not place any preconditions on the talks. Kerry's visit to Damascus comes as US President Barack Obama's nominee for ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford, awaits Senate confirmation. According to a post on the Foreign Policy magazine Web site's The Cable blog on Wednesday, the State Department recently sent a letter to key senators justifying its return of an ambassador to Syria - despite its poor human rights record, its violation of the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty, its support for Hamas and Hizbullah and its unhelpful efforts in the Arab League - on the grounds that an envoy in Damascus was needed to build the level of dialogue and interaction to help convince Syria improve its bad behavior. Eight Republican senators recently wrote a letter to US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton questioning what Syria had done to merit a return of the US ambassador."
16,BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-03-10,"Al-Jazeera TV talk show views Damascus summit, Iran-Hezbollah-Syria ties",,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"March 11, 2010",,"Doha Al-Jazeera Satellite Channel Television in Arabic - Independent Television station financed by the Qatari Government - at 1905 gmt on 6 March carries live a new episode of its weekly ""Open Dialogue"" talk show programme. Moderator Ghassan Bin-Jiddu interviews Antoine Zahrah, member of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies and leading figure in the Samir Ja'ja-led Lebanese Forces Party; and Abd-al-Halim Qindil, general coordinator of the Egyptian opposition Kifayah Movement and leading figure in the pan-Arab Current, in an outdoor place in Beirut. The programme also hosts four Lebanese citizens to participate in the discussion. Bin-Jiddu begins by saying: ""It is natural for heads of state to hold summit meetings, but a meeting between the Syrian and Iranian presidents in Damascus at this particular time has drawn criticism from Western capitals and some Arab countries. It is natural for a head of state to receive a party leader, but a meeting between Iranian President Ahmadinezhad and [Hezbollah Secretary General] Hasan Nasrallah to discuss regional developments and challenges has been questioned and even denounced by Arab capitals and Lebanon's political corridors. It is natural for the Palestinian resistance factions to receive financial aid or political support from the Arab and Islamic public opinion and some of our leaders. But Tehran turning into a source of aid explicitly or implicitly has been criticized by almost all of the Arab leaders. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i's reception of Palestinian faction leaders, particularly Khalid Mish'al, chief of the Hamas Political Bureau; Ramadan Abdallah Shallah, leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement; and Ahmad Jibril, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, at this particular time has drawn the attention of analysts. It is natural for Syrian President Bashar al-Asad to receive Hasan Nasrallah at the People's Palace in Damascus based on their political and strategic alliance, but a discussion between Al-Asad, Nasrallah, and Ahmadinezhad of how to confront Israel in any military action has drawn attention from decision-makers in Washington and Tel Aviv. The tripartite meeting, seen as a meeting of a war council, has pleased allies and supporters and angered foes and enemies. Is there a new strategy in the region and does what is going on pose any danger to the Arab interests?"" Asked whether the tripartite Damascus meeting was only intended to send a message to the United States and Israel or if we are witnessing a new regional strategy, Zahrah says ""the meeting came after the United States and Syria resumed their diplomatic ties and the US secretary of state set conditions for Syria to improve its relations with the United States."" He says ""the United States and Europe are trying to distance Syria from Iran on the backdrop of the latter's nuclear file, which is still subject to negotiations."" The meeting, he says, ""also came in response to Western attempts to undermine the two countries' alliance."" Nasrallah's participation in the meeting ""is also intended to assert the so-called resistance axis,"" he says, adding that ""many, including ourselves, believe Lebanon should not be used as a zone of conflict for the rival regional parties."" Lebanon ""should not join any Arab or regional axis or become a military zone of conflict,"" he says, adding that ""as far as the meeting is concerned, Hezbollah's strategy is unacceptable to the rest of the Lebanese people."" He says ""a new national dialogue is due to open within the next 72 hours to study Lebanon's defence strategy, as well as the role of Hezbollah's weapon as illegitimate."" The meeting ""is aimed at forcing Lebanon to join a strategy and a useless axis,"" he says, warning that ""if Iran is attacked on the backdrop of its nuclear file, it may use its arms in the Arab world."" Bin-Jiddu notes that the Arab homeland was divided into resistance and moderate camps after the July and Gaza wars, and the tripartite meeting in Damascus is seen as a meeting of a war council, asking if a new axis has been established in the region. Qidil says ""there is nothing new in this issue, simply because we all know that the Arab world is divided into Arab regimes and resistance factions."" He says ""the strategic alliance between Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, and Hamas shows a new Arab body with an Iranian head and an Arab regimes' body with a US head,"" describing this phenomenon ""as a flaw in the Arab scene."" Bin-Jiddu notes that the 14 March Movement in Lebanon, as well as some Arab regimes, enjoys US support whereas Hezbollah and the Palestinian resistance factions receive arms and funds from Iran. In response, Qindil says ""the Arab regimes, with the exception of Syria, are under the US-Israeli sponsorship and contribute to the Israeli war effort."" He says ""we are exposed to a three-pronged aggression by the Arab regimes, Israel, and the United States,"" adding that ""we have a US axis with an Arab body and an Arab axis with an Iranian body in the region."" Bin-Jiddu notes that Zahrah does not talk about the Arab order but about his group, which is part of the Arab political system that opposes illegitimate weapons, asking if the said three-pronged aggression is opposed by the Iranian-backed Arab popular resistance. Qindil says ""the resistance's weapon is legitimate under both divine and positive laws,"" stressing the need ""to place resistance above any other consideration as long occupation is still in place."" Asked what he means by any other consideration, Qindil says ""the partition of the Arab world under the Sikes-Picot Treaty is illegitimate."" He says ""allegations that the entire Lebanese people oppose Hezbollah's weapons are unfounded."" The 14 March group, ""which is about to collapse,"" he says, ""is backed by Saudi Arabia, the United States, and France."" Asked to respond, Zahrah says ""I neither oppose nor support Arab unity,"" adding that ""I am a Lebanese citizen belonging to the Arab world and committed to its causes."" It is not my duty either to establish an Arab unity or accuse colonialism of having partitioned the Arabs, he says, adding that ""I became reconciled with Arabism through the Al-Ta'if Agreement and the declaration of Arabism as a cultural association at the 2002 Beirut conference."" Any other concept of Arabism ""does not commit me to anything,"" he says, adding that ""I am committed to the Arabism, which I have chosen under the Al-Ta'if Agreement."" He says ""Lebanon is an Arab country, but I understand Arabism as a cultural association and not a project to establish a pan-Arab state with a religious background because I believe in diversity and accept the other."" He says ""a parliamentary election was held in Lebanon in 2009 on political principles and the majority of the Lebanese people voted for the state."" Warning that ""an armed force shares the state its authority,"" he says ""we reject this situation and would like to tell the brothers in Hezbollah that we are ready to accept its weapons as an essential defence force only under the supervision of the Lebanese Army and Government."" In response, Qindil says ""election results have nothing to do with Hezbollah's weapons, simply because if Walid Junblatt had joined the opposition before the election, the opposition would have won the majority."" Junblatt ""has completely abandoned the 14 March group,"" he says, adding that ""only the Lebanese Forces and the Phalange Party oppose Hezbollah."" He says ""the proposal partnership between the Lebanese Army and Hezbollah's weapons has been agreed to during discussions, but a proposal to annex the weapons to the army is unrealistic because Lebanon enjoys public liberates but not democracy."" Asked whether some parties are indirectly opposed to Hezbollah's weapons, Zahrah says that ""the 14 March group has declared its position on this issue."" The elections ""were held on political principles, but what some parties did later on is something else,"" he says, adding that ""the Lebanese people expressed its stand through the elections."" A citizen from the Phalange Party says ""if the Lebanese Government had tasked it [Hezbollah] with representing the state at the tripartite Damascus meeting, the Phalange Party would not have had any objection."" He says ""the summit has put Lebanon on the frontline through Hezbollah's unilateral action,"" warning that ""any war resulting from that summit will harm Lebanon, which has already become a war zone in the region."" Bin-Jiddu quotes Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'allim as saying that if Syria is attacked, it will retaliate forcefully. In response, Zahrah says ""the entire world knows that Syria will not be attacked, simply because Israel defends the Syrian regime."" A Palestinian from the Burj al-Barajinah refugee camp says that ""some Arabs are planning to strike Syria,"" criticizing Zahrah and hailing the positions of the resistance and Syria ""as constructive."" He complains that he and his children ""suffer from miserable living conditions."" In reaction, Zahrah says ""I have not attacked Arabism but said I oppose Arabism that is seeking an Islamic state, simply because I believe in diversity."" He recalls that ""under the Ottoman rule, Lebanon played a key role in preserving the Arab culture and language,"" expressing support ""for civil rights of the Palestinian people."" He says ""as long as the Palestine question remains unresolved, the Arab world will not enjoy any stability,"" adding that ""I Insist on the two-state solution only if it is impossible to remove Israel."" The problem, he says, ""is that a party in Lebanon pursues a policy that is rejected by the state."" Zahrah says ""Lebanon is likely to be forced to join any new regional axis without the agreement of the Lebanese Government."" Asked why the resistance axis keeps a high profile whereas the Arab regimes keep a low profile in the Arab scene, Qindil says ""the Arab countries have no Arab policy and the Arab regimes have been placed under the US-Israeli sponsorship."" He says ""the way the Arab regimes view the so-called Arab peace initiative shows that the Arab countries have abandoned the principle of peace for land and adopted the principle of peace for peace."" Therefore, ""nobody expects anything from the upcoming Arab summit in Tripoli,"" he says, adding that ""Syria is the weakest link and has no choice but to seek the help from the Iranian-backed resistance."" He says ""the Lebanese, Palestinian, and Iraqi resistance expresses the vitality of the Arab nation; has rolled the US army, the strongest in the world, in the dust; and defeated Israel or at least prevented the two sides from scoring any victory."" He says ""Iran has not established the resistance, though Tehran supports it financially and militarily."" Hezbollah's resistance in the history of the region ""is bigger than any Arab country,"" he says, praising Christians' role in protecting Arabism in the era of the Ottomans."" The majority of the Lebanese people, he says, ""are closer to the resistance than Zahrah."" Asked how he views the Iranian president and the Iranian supreme leader receiving resistance leaders in Damascus and Tehran respectively, a Palestinian from the group says ""the Palestinian resistance factions' meeting in Tehran and the recent tripartite Damascus meeting came in reaction to US intransigence, its project in the region, and Israel's aggression on the Palestinian people."" He says ""something is being prepared in the region, probably a new resistance axis,"" adding that ""the resistance project in the region is on the rise and the US project is in decline."" He says ""the United States faces serious problems in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" stressing that ""the resistance in Lebanon has succeeded in foiling Israeli designs."" Asked if this is right, Zahrah wonders ""where the US project has failed"" and says ""the improving US relations with Middle Eastern countries and its mediation in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations do not show that the US role has declined."" In response, Qindil says ""the so-called peace negotiations are a silly joke,"" adding that ""some hold negotiations for the sake of negotiations or to get some foreign aid."" He says that ""such negotiations are usually held by parties enjoying similar balances of power on the ground,"" wondering ""what Mahmud Abbas has on the ground other than General Dayton's forces."" Asked why he is trying to undermine the Arab legitimacy, Qindil says ""legitimacy must be established by the people,"" warning that ""the popular forces have been sidelined by the Arab regimes, including Syria."" The Lebanese citizen from the Phalange Party says ""the Lebanese people elected their representatives based on the 14 March group's political position."" Zahrah quotes Junblatt as denying that he has moved to the other side. The Phalange Party's member says ""we are only seeking stability in Lebanon."" Asked whether he is panicked by Nasrallah warning Israel that Hezbollah will retaliate forcefully if Lebanon is attacked, the Phalange Party's member says ""of course I am, because nobody has asked Nasrallah to make such a statement."" Another citizen says Nasrallah's speech is intended to assure the Lebanese that Hezbollah will defend the country. Asked if Ahmadinezhad's recent speech in Damascus indicates the establishment of a new regional axis, including Iraq, Qindil criticizes Iran's policy in Iraq ""as wrong."" He says ""what has happened is that Iran has filled the vacuum in Iraq in the absence of an Arab alternative."" Moreover, ""the Iraqi resistance is the only Arab resistance, which does enjoy any Iranian support,"" he says, adding that ""the recent speech by Nasrallah is part of a psychological warfare."" He says ""no resistance in history has as much force as its enemy, but that the enemy bows if the cost of aggression is higher than the gain."" He says ""in the first 50 years of life, Israel scored victories, but in the second 50 years, it suffered defeats, simply because its human resource has dried up."" Asked whether a balance of terror has been achieved in the region, Zahrah says ""Iran has penetrated the Arab world through the so-called Shi'i crescent."" Iran, ""which is seeking to become a superpower,"" he says, ""uses part of the Arab world and cooperates with Hamas, Hezbollah, and Yemen's Huthists to have arms in the Arab world."" Asked whether the said Shi'i crescent poses any danger, Qindil says ""I do not think that Michel Awn is Shi'i,"" adding that ""the weakness of the Arab world and Egypt's abandonment of its leading role have created a serious flaw in the region.""

17,The Jerusalem Post,2010-03-08,Look out!,,,Newspaper,HIGHLIGHT: Watching the Obama administration handle Syria and Iran is like watching a horror movie where a monster is creeping up behind someone. All you want to do is shout for that person to turn around. THE REGION. The writer is Director at the Global Research in International Affairs Center (GLORIA) (http://www.gloria-center.org) and editor of the Middle East Review of International Affairs Journal (MERIA). He blogs at The Rubin Report (http://rubinreports.blogspot.com),,ENGLISH,OPINION; Pg. 15,"March 11, 2010",988 words,"The stories of the US engagement with Syria and the sanctions issue regarding Iran's nuclear program are fascinating. Each day there's some new development showing how the Obama administration is acting like a deer standing in the middle of a busy highway admiring the pretty headlights of the automobiles. Briefly, the Syrian government keeps punching the US in the face as Washington ignores it. On March 1, a new record was set. The place: State Department daily press conference; the star, spokesman Philip J. Crowley. A reporter asks how the administration views the fact that the moment a US delegation left after urging Syrian President Bashar Assad to move away from Iran and stop supporting Hizbullah, Syria's dictator invited Iran's dictator along with Hizbullah's leader to visit. In other words, the exact opposite of what the US requested. Is the government annoyed? Does it want to express some anger or issue a threat? Let's listen. Crowley: ""Well, I would point it in a slightly different direction... We want to see Syria play a more constructive role in the region. We also want - to the extent that it has the ability to talk to Iran directly - we want to make sure that Syria's communicating to Iran its concerns about its role in the region and the direction, the nature of its nuclear ambitions..."" In other words, I'm going to ignore the fact that the first thing that Assad did after Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs William Burns's visit was a love fest with Iran and Hizbullah. But even more amazing, what Crowley said is that the US government thinks Syria, Iran's partner and ally, may be upset that Iran is being aggressive and expansionist. And it actually expects the Syrians to urge Iran not to build nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, as the administration congratulates itself on explaining to Syria that it should reduce support for Hizbullah, IDF military intelligence releases an assessment that Syria is giving Hizbullah more and better arms than ever before. MEANWHILE, ON the Iran front, it is now March and still - six months after the first administration deadline and three months after the second deadline - no major sanctions on Iran. Remarkably, even former Democratic presidential candidate and head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee John Kerry has taken a stronger stance than the administration. He supports the congressional call for tough sanctions to block Iran's energy industry which easily passed both houses. ""I believe that the most biting and important sanctions would be those on the energy side."" But the Obama administration wants far more limited sanctions focused on a small group in the regime elite. Yet sanctions are getting further away rather than closer. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hinted at this by pulling back from her early prediction of sanctions by April, now saying it might be ""some time in the next several months."" At the same time, we have endless evidence that the claim the Russians (and Chinese and others) are coming to support sanctions is nonsense. Just before meeting with Clinton to discuss the issue, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva explained, ""Peace in the world does not mean isolating someone."" (Quick, invite him to explain this to the anti-Israel forces in Europe and elsewhere.) But it's outright amusing to see the efforts to spin the Russian and Chinese position. In this regard, the prize for this week should be won by an AP dispatch whose headline read: ""Russia moves closer to Iran sanctions over nukes."" And what is the basis for this claim that there has just been ""the strongest sign to date that the Kremlin was prepared to drop traditional opposition to such penalties if Teheran remain obstinate?"" This statement from President Dmitry Medvedev: ""We believe that [engagement with Iran is] not over yet, that we can still reach an agreement. But if we don't succeed, Russia is ready - along with our partners... to consider the question of adopting sanctions."" Get it? When Russia decides that talking with Iran won't work, at that point - how long from now would that be? - it will ""consider"" sanctions. Actually, he said the same thing last August, a statement trumpeted in September by The New York Times as proving Obama's policy was working. There is more clarity with the Chinese, though the pretense is also made that they might do something. But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang put it this way: ""We believe there is still room for diplomatic efforts and the parties concerned should intensify those efforts."" At most, the optimists suggest, in the words of this Reuters dispatch: ""China will resist any proposed sanctions that threaten flows of oil and Chinese investments, but most believe it will accept a more narrowly cast resolution that has more symbolic than practical impact."" Yes, that's the kind of thing that already existed four years ago. Some progress. Is it too much to ask policy-makers to pay attention to what's going on occasionally? So let's leave it to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to sum up how things seem to Iran, Syria, Hamas, Hizbullah and many others. The Americans, he said, ""not only have failed to gain any power, but also are forced to leave the region. They are leaving their reputation, image and power behind in order to escape... The [American] government has no influence [to stop] the expansion of Iran-Syria ties, Syria-Turkey ties and Iran- Turkey ties - God willing, Iraq too will join the circle."" I think this suggests that the radicals think that the US is weak, in retreat, and that the future belongs to them. In other words, US President Barack Obama's policy isn't moderating the radicals, it's making them more aggressive and confident."

""That is something that must stop in order to promote regional stability and security,"" Kerry said about the weapons. Washington has reached out to Syria in recent months by nominating the first US ambassador to Damascus since 2005 and sending top diplomats to meet with Assad. Kerry's visit to Syria is the latest in a series of American officials to make the trip, as Washington pushes for the country's cooperation in Middle East peace efforts and the standoff over Iran's nuclear program. Washington is hoping to draw Syria away from Iran and the militant groups Hizbullah and Hamas. Its decision in February to appoint the first US ambassador to Damascus in five years was ""evidence that engagement with Syria is a priority at the highest levels of our government,"" said the former US presidential candidate. Envoy Robert Ford is still awaiting US confirmation of his new post, but ""he will be an excellent representative of the president's policies and an outstanding envoy to the Syrian government,"" Kerry said. Syria is a strong supporter of militant groups such as the Iranian-backed Hizbullah and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, whose exiled leadership is based in Damascus. ""Syria is an essential player in bringing peace and stability to the region,"" Kerry said. Turkey mediated several rounds of indirect negotiations between Syria and Israel in 2008, but the discussions made no significant headway. Direct talks between the Mideast enemies broke down in 2000. The Syrian news agency said that Kerry and Assad stressed the need of continuing ""constructive dialogue"" between Syria and United States based on ""mutual respect and common interests to reach positive solutions for issues of common interest"" the agency said. Kerry said Washington and Syria ""have a very deep interest, a mutual interest"" in having a very frank exchange on any differences if they exist.

During a visit with the Syrian honorary consuls to the liberated city of Al-Quneitera, Al-Miqdad stressed that the practices of the Israeli occupation against the people of the occupied Syrian Golan are considered war crimes against humanity. He pointed out to the Israeli attempts to exhaust the resources of the occupied Syrian Golan and obliterate all aspects of civilization in it through stealing the water of Masada Lake and preventing the people of the Golan from using it. The Deputy Foreign Minister said the Syrian government is exerting all efforts to improve the living conditions of citizens in Quneitera province whose villages and houses were destroyed by the Israeli occupation forces. He called on honorary consuls to be committed to their responsibilities towards Syria and uncover the falseness of the Israeli allegations and aggressive practices in the city. For his part, Governor of Quneitera Dr Ryiadh Hijab reviewed the geographical and economic history of the province. He talked about the deliberate destruction of the city and the suffering of the Golan people because of the Israeli arbitrary practices. He pointed out to the Syrian detainees who have been in Israeli prisons for tens of years because they rejected the Israeli identity and were committed to their Syrian identities. For their part, the honorary consuls, who inspected the barbaric destruction caused by the Israeli war machine, stressed their solidarity with the people of the province and their homeland, Syria, in facing the Israeli occupation. They affirmed they would work hard to uncover the allegations of occupation before the world public opinion at international gatherings in all expatriate countries.

20,BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2011-01-01,Obama appoints US ambassador to Syria as part of policy of engagement - paper,,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"January 1, 2011",,"Text of report by London-based newspaper Al-Hayat website on 31 December [Report by Joyce Karam in Washington: Obamas Administration Sticks to the Policy of Engagement With Syria: Firm Messages on Three Files that worry the United States] President Barack Obama sidestepped the Republicans in Congress and issued a presidential decree according to which he appointed the diplomat, Stephen Ford, as ambassador to Syria in a step that reflects his administration's adherence to the policy of engagement with Damascus in spite of the continued disagreement between the two countries on regional files. The leaders of the right in Congress strongly opposed appointing Ford and giving ""unwarranted concessions to Damascus"" by Obama. In a presidential decree, the White House announced on Wednesday night [29 December] appointing Ford an ambassador to Damascus after Congress obstructed this appointment for 10 months due to its reservations on Syria's conduct and the accusations against it of arming Hezbollah in Lebanon. This step was carried out before the new Congress takes over its tasks in the New Year. The recent holiday of the current Congress is taking place amid fears by the Administration concerning the prolonged delaying of many appointment by the Republicans. Traditionally, this decree continues to be effective for one year until the next annual holiday. A US official told Al-Hayat that the Administration is committed to the ""policy of engagement"" with Damascus and that it is aspiring for ""a serious and constructive dialogue on the level of the higher leadership in Syria"" that would be conducted by Ford, who is expected to start his new tasks soon. He added: ""We have crucial interests in Damascus and across the Middle East and the absence of an ambassador does not help in anything other than playing against the US interests."" He added that ""sending an ambassador to Damascus is not viewed in terms of a reward for the Syrian Government, but it strengthens our ability to convey firm messages to the Syrian Government and express clearly the issues that concern us and our priorities to Syria."" At the same time, the official did not underestimate the strong points of disagreement and complications on three files; namely, the peace process, Iraq, and the Lebanese-Syrian relations. Obama's step has been met with resentment by the Republicans in Congress and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the new chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who expressed in a statement her ""great disappointment with the president's offering of a concession of this size to the Syrian regime."" She added: ""During the past two years, Syria has continued to sponsor violent extremism and pursue dangerous weapons programmes, and has also supplied long-range missiles to Hezbollah and reasserted its destabilizing influence in Lebanon at the expense of that nation's sovereignty."" She pointed out that ""giving unwarranted concessions to Syria tells the regime in Damascus that it can continue its dangerous agenda and not face any consequences from the United States."" She also said: ""This is not the message that we want to convey to a regime that continues to harm and threaten the interests of the United States and its key allies, such as Israel."" Ford was chosen as a result of his long diplomatic background and because he is proficient in Arabic, in addition to the French, German and Turkish languages. He is considered to be from the Arabist team at the Department of State, which means those who somewhat sympathize with the Arab society and civilization. Ford was an ambassador in Algeria for a short period between the summer of 2006 and early 2008, and he was transferred to Iraq at the request of Ryan Crocker, former ambassador there. Ford is known to be aware of Iraqi affairs and he had a role after the invasion in 2003 in moving the political process and pushing for admitting the Sunnis into it. The White House has pointed out Ford's long diplomatic experience since the early 1980's. In Paris, according to the AFP, Christine Fages, spokeswoman for the French Foreign Ministry, said that ""appointing a US ambassador to Syria is a strong reassurance signal from the United States to Damascus."" She added that this decision ""underlines the US will to have a constructive dialogue with Syria, and such a dialogue can only contribute to strengthening stability in the region and the peace efforts.""

21,The Daily Star (Lebanon),2010-07-16,Geagea warns of flaws in relations with Syria,,20,Newspaper,,Abdullah Iskandar,ENGLISH,,"May 6, 2010",719 words,"Geagea was referring to Syrian criticism of the latest UN report on the implementation of Resolution 1701. The Syrian Foreign Ministry submitted a letter to the UN criticizing UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon's report, which addressed the developments in Lebanese-Syrian bilateral ties. ""The report of the secretary general continued to interfere in the development of Syrian-Lebanese ties,"" the Syrian letter said in its introduction. Geagea said that despite Prime Minister Saad Hariri's efforts to normalize ties with Damascus, several deep flaws still governed bilateral relations. ""As long as these flaws exist, we will seek to block them and the issue will remain a subject of Arab [political discussions] on the one hand and the international community on the other,"" Geagea said. Lebanese President Michel Sleiman and Prime Minister Saad Hariri have held several rounds of talks with Syrian President Bashar Assad over the past few months that led to the ratification of several new bilateral agreements. But no progress has been made on border demarcation. Damascus has agreed to demarcate the maritime border but continued to stall on land demarcation, saying the step would serve US and EU interests. The UN has repeatedly demanded the demarcation of the borders to prevent arms smuggling to Hizbullah in line with Resolution 1701. ""Lebanon and Syria were granted their independence 65 years ago, so what prevents the border demarcation?"" Geagea asked, adding that ""unlike Arab states, the border possess clear landmarks rather than deserts."" Geagea also criticized Syria's remarks on the UN report with regard to armed Palestinian groups outside refugee camps. Rival Lebanese political groups decided during National Dialogue talks in 2006 to disarm Palestinian groups mainly in the Bekaa region with known loyalty and affiliations with to Damascus. - The Daily Star 22 of 266 DOCUMENTS Dar Al Hayat (Lebanon) May 5, 2010 Wednesday International Edition The United States and the Sanctions on Syria It is no surprise that the US Administration extended the sanctions on Syria for another year. Rather, it would be a surprise if President Barack Obama cancelled these sanctions. While the While House statement pointed to the Syrian improved behavior in Iraq, it recalled all the US campaign that started a few weeks ago on the smuggling of arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon. This means that for the White House, the US-Syrian confrontation in Lebanon is equivalent to a confrontation that pertains to the US national security, especially after Hezbollah regained its decisive influence over the Lebanese internal arena, and focused on pursuing the US relations with the official state of Lebanon and the cooperation agreements signed by the former government headed by Fouad Siniora with Washington. While this issue is not promising regarding the political stability, and perhaps the security-related stability later in Lebanon, it reveals at the same time that Syria has regained much of its influence that has been weakened since 2005, i.e. following its military withdrawal from the country of the cedars. This influence is further expanding now, with more pressures to impose a US withdrawal and restrict the movement of the Lebanese government and expand the influence of Hezbollah, which the United States considers to be the spearhead of Iran with which it is embroiled in a battle throughout the region. In this sense, Washington believes that the Syrian support for Hezbollah targets its influence and political interests in Lebanon. It also believes that the continuation of this support threatens the US interests in the region. The justifications given for extending the sanctions - regardless of whether or not the reports on the [Scud] missiles and their influence on the military power of balance are true - state that the Syrian political influence in Lebanon is negative, from Washington's perspective, when Hezbollah's positions on internal matters prevails. This negative aspect was revealed in a number of internal developments, starting with the crisis of the presidential elections, to the parliamentary elections, to the formation of the current government, as well as the targeting of the Lebanese-US agreements. Following the tangible improvement in the contacts between both sides and the inclination to send an American ambassador to Damascus, the current US campaign was escalated on Syria perhaps because [the United States] realized that the policy of engagement failed in changing the Syrian behavior, in terms of fine-tuning the positions of Hezbollah according to the American policy. One of the important conclusions in this context is that the Lebanese vote in the Security Council - when bringing up the decision of sanctions on Iran regarding its nuclear file - is influenced by the internal political power of Hezbollah, not by the US demands to support these sanctions. The other issue which the US Administration wagers on currently in the region and which concerns Syria directly, pertains to the resumption of the negotiations on the Palestinian track. While Washington extends efforts to convince both the Palestinian and Israeli parties to resume negotiations - albeit indirect talks in the first stage - Damascus manifests a position that opposes these efforts. The extent of the US annoyance with the Syrian obstruction could be seen through Washington's reiterated commitment to achieve progress in this dossier. Indeed, the United States was not pleased with the recent Syrian reservation, during the American ministerial meeting in Cairo a few days ago, over commissioning the Palestinian party to engage in indirect talks with Israel, especially since the US Administration has sought to advertise these negotiations to the Arabs. Rather, as it reiterated on many occasions, Washington considers that resuming these negotiations comes at the heart of its national interests. In this context, the issue of the missiles smuggled to Hezbollah becomes the overt justification to announce the US displeasure with the overall Syrian behavior and to send a message stating that the [Syrian] discipline that Washington noticed in the Iraqi dossier is not enough, and that Damascus should manifest similar discipline in Lebanon and the Palestinian negotiations' track."

Iran's growing influence in the Arab region since the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, and its links to Syria, Lebanon's Hizbullah, Hamas and various groups in Iraq, have alarmed US-allied powers such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Weaning Syria away from Tehran is seen by some as a key to getting Hamas to soften its position in reconciliation talks with the rival Fatah party, led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Saudi state news agency SPA said Syrian President Assad had arrived in Riyadh and would stay in Saudi Arabia for ""several days."" At a news conference with his Chinese counterpart, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said Assad and King Abdullah would discuss ""Arab reconciliation,"" but declined to say if Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak would join the talks. Reaching a positive outcome could hinge on the participation of Mubarak whose country's efforts at brokering a deal between the main two Palestinian factions have been hurt by what it perceives as an unconstructive approach from Syria. ""The aim is to reconcile the Palestinians with the help of the Syrians. But it is a triangle: Egyptians should also be here which means we need to reconcile them with the Syrians. If Mubarak joins the talks then we will achieve a breakthrough,"" said Jamal Khashoggi, a former Saudi senior diplomat who is editor of Al-Watan newspaper. Officials gave few details about the agenda of the Riyadh talks. The visit followed intense diplomatic efforts leading to a rare visit earlier this month to Riyadh by Hamas' political leader Khaled Meshaal. Diplomats say Iran's nuclear program will also feature in the talks. Washington is threatening more UN sanctions against a program it fears could allow Tehran to build nuclear weapons. 24 of 266 DOCUMENTS The Middle East Reporter (MER) December 15, 2010 Wednesday Assad Discusses Regional Situation and Bilateral Relationship in Qatar Syrian President Bashar al-Assad held talks in Doha on Tuesday with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani in a lightning visit which last just a few hours, reported pan-Arab daily AL HAYAT on Wednesday. The two met in the presence of their respective foreign ministers and it was announced that a number of Qatari ministers attended ""the review of bilateral relations on cooperation and ways to strengthen and develop the relationship in all fields."" Assad's previously unannounced sudden visit came a few days after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak visited Qatar. The visit signals the ""high level political coordination between the leadership of Qatar and Syria,"" reported the daily. It is thought that the talks mainly dealt with the situation in Lebanon in light of Syrian and Saudi efforts to calm the situation, reported AL HAYAT. Sheikh Hamad talked of ""the importance of adopting dialogue to resolve contentious issues in Lebanon ... and to help the Lebanese maintain security and stability in Lebanon."" A Syrian presidential statement said that the ""two sides stressed the importance of continued consultations and coordination between Syria and Qatar,"" reported influential Beirut daily AN NAHAR. Other sources pointed out that with Assad's visit coming on the eve of a meeting of the Arab League in Cairo then the talks must have mainly dealt with the Palestinian situation. As an indicator of this, Khalid Meshaal, the political head of Palestinian faction Hamas visited Doha a few days ago, noted AL HAYAT. Assad said, ""we talked about many subjects and dealt with the situation in Iraq and issue of its forming of a government. And we also talked about the escalation [of tensions] in Lebanon. Additionally we talked about bilateral relations and other issues."" When asked whether he thought the announcement by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) would lead to chaos in Lebanon, Assad answered, ""I do not want to say that we agree or do not agree. This issue is in Lebanon and not Syria. For Syria, generally, we do not accept any charge in any case without proof, and not only in the case of Lebanon."" The STL is a UN-backed investigation into, primarily, the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri who was killed in a massive truck bombing in Beirut in 2005. Both Syria and it's Lebanese ally Hizbullah have been implicated in his murder. Tension is mounting in Lebanon with the STL expected to issue indictments in the near future. Hizbullah has labeled the STL an ""Israel project."" Sheikh Hamad was asked if there was a joint Syria-Qatar initiative in Lebanon. He replied that the issue was still in the hands of Syria and Saudi Arabia and that he was positive that Damascus and Riyadh were keen to prevent civil strife in Lebanon, reported AN NAHAR. Also on Tuesday, Bahrain's Foreign Minister Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmad bin Mohammad al-Khalifa visited Doha. According to a source, the reason given for the visit was to ""boost ties"", reported AL HAYAT. 25 of 266 DOCUMENTS BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring July 11, 2010 Sunday US embassy in Damascus comments on senator's talks with Syrian leader Text of report by Saudi-owned leading pan-Arab daily Al-Sharq al-Awsat website on 11 July [Report from Tel Aviv and Damascus by Nazir Mujalli and Su'ad Jarrus respectively: ""A Jewish American Senator Close to the Al-Asad Family Mediates Between Israel and Syria. The US Embassy in Damascus Tells Al-Sharq al-Awsat Specter and Al-Asad Discussed Revival of the Peace Talks""] Israeli media disclosed yesterday that US Senator Arlen Specter conveys messages between Tel Aviv and Damascus in an attempt to resume Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations. Israeli sources claimed that Specter is conducting this mediation effort on request by Syrian President Bashar al-Asad who asked him to seriously discuss this issue with Israeli officials. The sources said Senator Specter arrived in Jerusalem last week to hear the Israeli point of view. They added that he wanted to meet with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, but because the latter two were out of the country, he was received by Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon who gave him an Israeli message to Al-Asad. These sources said Ayalon conveyed to Senator Specter the traditional Israeli stand that Israel is ready for negotiations with Syria anytime and anywhere, provided that these negotiations will be conducted without preconditions. Senator Specter is an 80-year-old Jewish American who will quit the Senate at the end of this year after 30 years of service because he did not win the Democratic Party's internal elections. He is known for maintaining friendly relations with Damascus, which he visited 18 times during his political career. He closely knows President Bashar al-Asad and his father, late President Hafiz al-Asad. At the same time, he has good relations with Israel and the Jewish American lobby. He quit the Republican Party and joined the Democratic Party last year because he is convinced of President Barack Obama's policy, especially his efforts and insistence on resolving the Middle East conflict. The Israelis believe that President Al-Asad's choice of Senator Specter shows cleverness for he is an honest, reliable, and influential figure in the world. They believe that, with his rich experience, he can effectively contribute to the negotiations. They said that Al-Asad previously asked Brazil to mediate between him and Israel. An official at the US Embassy in Damascus told Al-Sharq al-Awsat that Senator Specter held constructive and in-depth talks with Al-Asad in Damascus on Thursday. He added that the two men discussed ""specific steps to consolidate regional stability, revive the Syrian-Israeli peace talks, and strengthen the relations between the United States and Syria."" He noted that the talks focused on ""the enormous challenges that face the region."" The official said: ""Senator Specter reiterated Syria's importance as a partner in the efforts towards a comprehensive regional peace. He also asserted his commitment to seeing appointed Ambassador Ford being confirmed by the Senate."" The official refused to give more details on Specter's talks in Damascus. The US Embassy announced these talks two days later, that is, yesterday afternoon, Saturday. The official did not confirm or deny that Specter will visit Damascus again this week. Damascus, which did not officially announce Senator Specter's visit, did not comment on what was said about it. However, observers told Al-Sharq al-Awsat: ""The US peace talks focus on the Palestinian track, because the United States wants Syria not to block the calls for direct talks between the PNA and Israel."" The observers added: ""The situation is well known. Syria seeks peace but the Israeli Government is not ready for peace."" The observers in Damascus slighted the Yediot Aharonot Newspaper report that Senator Specter conveyed a message from Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon to Syrian President Bashar al-Asad. The paper did not disclose its content. The observers said: ""This is illogical and does not deserve comment."" They asked: ""How can a deputy foreign minister send a message to the president of a state?"" Source: Al-Sharq al-Awsat website, London, in Arabic 11 Jul 10"
26,The Washington Post,2010-04-14,"Israel: Syria giving Scuds to Hezbollah; Damascus denies transfer of missiles, which would alter regional military balance",Suburban Edition,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,A-SECTION; Pg. A08,"April 14, 2010",528 words,"Israeli President Shimon Peres on Tuesday accused Syria of transferring long-range Scud missiles to the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, appearing to confirm rumors that have swirled in the region in recent weeks. Syria denied the charge, calling it a bid by Israel to divert attention from its policies in the Palestinian territories. A transfer of Scud missiles, which have a range of 430 miles, would sharply shift the military balance in the region. Hezbollah, which fought a war with Israel in 2006, has been able to strike cities and towns in northern Israel only with short-range missiles, but Scuds would allow it to attack Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Reports of the transfer have also begun to complicate the Obama administration's plans to appoint an ambassador to Damascus, Syria, for the first time in five years. ""Syria claims that it wants peace, while simultaneously delivering Scud missiles to Hezbollah, which is constantly threatening the security of the state of Israel,"" Peres told Israel Radio before leaving for meetings in France. He repeated the allegation in a meeting with French Prime Minister FranÃ§ois Fillon, saying: ""Syria is playing a double game. On the one hand it talks peace, yet at the same time it hands over accurate Scud missiles to Hezbollah so that it can threaten Israel."" U.S. officials acknowledge they are worried about weapons transfers from Syria to Lebanon but say they do not have a clear picture of what has actually taken place. ""We are increasingly concerned about the sophistication of the weaponry being transferred and have continued to reiterate our strong concerns to the Syrian and Lebanese authorities and made clear they need to be taking steps that reduce the risk and danger of conflict, not steps that increase it,"" said National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer. Asked whether U.S. intelligence agencies think Scud missiles have been moved into Lebanon, a U.S. official briefed on the matter said, ""I don't think we know whether they've gone over or not."" But he said that ""there has been significant concern in the intelligence community"" that Syria had provided missiles to Hezbollah or was poised to do so. Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, visited Lebanon and Syria two weeks ago and raised the issue of weapons transfers with President Bashar al-Assad. Kerry spokesman Frederick Jones said that the specifics of what the senator learned before he left for Syria were classified but that Kerry ""recognizes that the flow of weapons to Hezbollah raises very legitimate concerns in Israel and with all parties seeking peace in the region."" The Foreign Relations Committee approved on a voice vote Tuesday the nomination of Robert Ford as the new ambassador, but three GOP senators noted their objection and congressional aides said a floor vote may face delays unless the administration can provide answers on the Israeli allegations. Syrian Ambassador Imad Moustapha denounced the reports as a ""ridiculous story"" created by Israel and its allies to spoil the possibility of a rapprochement with the United States. He said no U.S. official has raised the issue with him."

But he described the appointment of a new ambassador as a positive signal of intent by the administration of President Barack Obama. ""This is a clear sign after five years without an ambassador in Damascus of America's readiness to improve relations and to cooperate to pursue a just and comprehensive peace between Arabs and Israelis,"" said Burns. The White House was keen to ""make progress on all tracks in the peace process and to pursue regional peace and stability,"" the US diplomat told reporters after meeting Assad. ""There are challenges on the road but my meeting with President Assad leaves me hopeful that we can make progress together in the interest of both our countries. ""I had quite productive and extensive discussions with President Assad. We talked about areas on which we disagree but also we found areas of common ground on which we can build,"" Burns said. Washington's ties with Damascus had been strained by Syria's three-decade-old alliance with Iran and US allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor Iraq. Career diplomat Robert Ford will be the first US ambassador to Damascus since Washington recalled its envoy after Lebanon's former prime minister Rafiq Hariri was killed in February 2005 in a bombing blamed on Syria. ""Ambassador Ford is a highly accomplished diplomat with many years of experience in the Middle East,"" said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs. ""If confirmed by the Senate, ambassador Ford will engage the Syrian government on how we can enhance relations, while addressing areas of ongoing concern."" But the nomination ignited a festering row with Republicans over Obama's signature policy of seeking to engage governments considered hostile to Washington. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the top Republican on the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee, blasted the move as ""reckless engagement"" and a reward for a US enemy. ""With this nomination, our foreign policy again risks sending the message that it is better to be an intractable enemy than a cooperative, loyal US ally,"" she said in a statement. ""Despite the administration's outreach, Syria continues to sponsor violent extremist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, to undermine Lebanon's sovereignty, and to pursue unconventional weapons and missile capabilities."" Obama has seen his efforts to engage Iran and broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians founder in his first year in office, and the overture to Syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock. But analysts say it seems unlikely that Assad's government, with a first priority of ensuring its own survival, will be keen to sever links with Iran or make immediate concessions to Israel. US officials may be keen to increase intelligence cooperation with Syria, although its stakeholding in Lebanon through Shia militant group Hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties. Ford, currently deputy chief of mission in the US embassy in Baghdad, was previously ambassador to Algeria, and has also had postings in Turkey and Egypt in a 25-year career in the US foreign service. Obama apparently paved the way for the announcement on Friday, calling Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri to tell him he strongly supports the effort to bring the killers of his late father to justice. The previous administration of president George W. Bush recalled the US ambassador from Damascus and put relations with Syria on hold in 2005, following Rafiq Hariri's killing. His death in a massive bomb blast on the Beirut seafront in February of that year was widely blamed on Syria, although Damascus has denied any involvement. An international tribunal based in The Hague was set up by a UN Security Council resolution in 2007 to try suspects in the murder. A UN commission of inquiry initially said it had found evidence to implicate Syrian and Lebanese intelligence services but there are no suspects in custody. 28 of 266 DOCUMENTS The New York Times April 2, 2010 Friday Late Edition - Final Kerry Tries To Nudge Syria To Re-engage With the U.S. CAIRO -- Senator John Kerry met Thursday with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in Damascus, another indication that the United States is moving to re-engage with Syria as the Obama administration works to resuscitate Middle East peace talks. Mr. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, visited Damascus, Syria's capital, as the Senate takes up the appointment of a new ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford. The United States has not had an ambassador in Damascus since 2005, shortly after the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri. Syria was blamed for the killing, an accusation that it has denied. After his meeting with Mr. Assad, Mr. Kerry said in a statement that the United States and Syria shared ''a mutual interest in having a very frank exchange on any differences that may exist, but also on the many, many agreements that we have about the possibilities of peace in this region.'' The United States and its Arab allies are hopeful that re-engagement with Syria may encourage its leaders to distance themselves from Iran, an economic and strategic alliance that Syria has fostered for decades. Mr. Kerry has also expressed concern over Syria's role in providing arms to Hezbollah, a Lebanese militia and a political and social organization deemed a terrorist group by the United States. In 2003, Mr. Kerry co-sponsored the Syrian Accountability Act, which imposed sanctions on Damascus. But he has since pushed for renewed dialogue. In a statement last month at the nomination hearing for Mr. Ford, Mr. Kerry said, ''The real challenge is not deciding whether to engage -- it will be in finding a viable path to improved relations.'' Because Syria is faced with a looming economic crisis as its oil wells run dry, and because it has a growing population of young people who need jobs and housing, Syria has an incentive to re-engage with the West, he said."

International criticism is not without significance, but nations do not change direction absent direct threats to their interests. But powers outside the region are unlikely to exert military power against Israel, and even significant economic or political sanctions are unlikely to happen. Apart from the desire of outside powers to limit their involvement, this is rooted in the fact that significant actions are unlikely from inside the region either. The first generations of Israelis lived under the threat of conventional military defeat by neighboring countries. More recent generations still faced threats, but not this one. Israel is operating in an advantageous strategic context save for the arena of public opinion and diplomatic relations and the question of Iranian nuclear weapons. All of these issues are significant, but none is as immediate a threat as the specter of a defeat in conventional warfare had been. Israel's regional enemies are so profoundly divided among themselves and have such divergent relations with Israel that an effective coalition against Israel does not exist -- and is unlikely to arise in the near future. Given this, the probability of an effective, as opposed to rhetorical, shift in the behavior of powers outside the region is unlikely. At every level, Israel's Arab neighbors are incapable of forming even a partial coalition against Israel. Israel is not forced to calibrate its actions with an eye toward regional consequences, explaining Israel's willingness to accept broad international condemnation. Palestinian Divisions To begin to understand how deeply the Arabs are split, simply consider the split among the Palestinians themselves. They are currently divided between two very different and hostile factions. On one side is Fatah, which dominates the West Bank. On the other side is Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip. Aside from the geographic division of the Palestinian territories -- which causes the Palestinians to behave almost as if they comprised two separate and hostile countries -- the two groups have profoundly different ideologies. Fatah arose from the secular, socialist, Arab-nationalist and militarist movement of Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser in the 1950s. Created in the 1960s, Fatah was closely aligned with the Soviet Union. It was the dominant, though far from the only, faction in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The PLO was an umbrella group that brought together the highly fragmented elements of the Palestinian movement. Yasser Arafat long dominated Fatah; his death left Fatah without a charismatic leader, but with a strong bureaucracy increasingly devoid of a coherent ideology or strategy. Hamas arose from the Islamist movement. It was driven by religious motivations quite alien from Fatah and hostile to it. For Hamas, the liberation of Palestine was not simply a nationalist imperative, but also a religious requirement. Hamas was also hostile to what it saw as the financial corruption Arafat brought to the Palestinian movement, as well as to Fatah's secularism. Hamas and Fatah are playing a zero-sum game. Given their inability to form a coalition and their mutual desire for the other to fail, a victory for one is a defeat for the other. This means that whatever public statements Fatah makes, the current international focus on Gaza and Hamas weakens Fatah. And this means that at some point, Fatah will try to undermine the political gains the flotilla has offered Hamas. The Palestinians' deep geographic, ideological and historical divisions occasionally flare up into violence. Their movement has always been split, its single greatest weakness. Though revolutionary movements frequently are torn by sectarianism, these divisions are so deep that even without Israeli manipulation, the threat the Palestinians pose to the Israelis is diminished. With manipulation, the Israelis can pit Fatah against Hamas. The Arab States and the Palestinians The split within the Palestinians is also reflected in divergent opinions among what used to be called the confrontation states surrounding Israel -- Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Egypt, for example, is directly hostile to Hamas, a religious movement amid a sea of essentially secular Arab states. Hamas' roots are in Egypt's largest Islamist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, which the Egyptian state has historically considered its main domestic threat. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's regime has moved aggressively against Egyptian Islamists and sees Hamas' ideology as a threat, as it could spread back to Egypt. For this and other reasons, Egypt has maintained its own blockade of Gaza. Egypt is much closer to Fatah, whose ideology derives from Egyptian secularism, and for this reason, Hamas deeply distrusts Cairo. Jordan views Fatah with deep distrust. In 1970, Fatah under Arafat tried to stage a revolution against the Hashemite monarchy in Jordan. The resulting massacres, referred to as Black September, cost about 10,000 Palestinian lives. Fatah has never truly forgiven Jordan for Black September, and the Jordanians have never really trusted Fatah since then. The idea of an independent Palestinian state on the West Bank unsettles the Hashemite regime, as Jordan's population is mostly Palestinian. Meanwhile, Hamas with its Islamist ideology worries Jordan, which has had its own problems with the Muslim Brotherhood. So rhetoric aside, the Jordanians are uneasy at best with the Palestinians, and despite years of Israeli-Palestinian hostility, Jordan (and Egypt) has a peace treaty with Israel that remains in place. Syria is far more interested in Lebanon than it is in the Palestinians. Its co-sponsorship (along with Iran) of Hezbollah has more to do with Syria's desire to dominate Lebanon than it does with Hezbollah as an anti-Israeli force. Indeed, whenever fighting breaks out between Hezbollah and Israel, the Syrians get nervous and their tensions with Iran increase. And of course, while Hezbollah is anti-Israeli, it is not a Palestinian movement. It is a Lebanese Shiite movement. Most Palestinians are Sunni, and while they share a common goal -- the destruction of Israel -- it is not clear that Hezbollah would want the same kind of regime in Palestine that either Hamas or Fatah would want. So Syria is playing a side game with an anti-Israeli movement that isn't Palestinian, while also maintaining relations with both factions of the Palestinian movement. Outside the confrontation states, the Saudis and other Arabian Peninsula regimes remember the threat that Nasser and the PLO posed to their regimes. They do not easily forgive, and their support for Fatah comes in full awareness of the potential destabilizing influence of the Palestinians. And while the Iranians would love to have influence over the Palestinians, Tehran is more than 1,000 miles away. Sometimes Iranian arms get through to the Palestinians. But Fatah doesn't trust the Iranians, and Hamas, though a religious movement, is Sunni while Iran is Shiite. Hamas and the Iranians may cooperate on some tactical issues, but they do not share the same vision. Israel's Short-term Free Hand and Long-term Challenge Given this environment, it is extremely difficult to translate hostility to Israeli policies in Europe and other areas into meaningful levers against Israel. Under these circumstances, the Israelis see the consequences of actions that excite hostility toward Israel from the Arabs and the rest of the world as less dangerous than losing control of Gaza. The more independent Gaza becomes, the greater the threat it poses to Israel. The suppression of Gaza is much safer and is something Fatah ultimately supports, Egypt participates in, Jordan is relieved by and Syria is ultimately indifferent to. Nations base their actions on risks and rewards. The configuration of the Palestinians and Arabs rewards Israeli assertiveness and provides few rewards for caution. The Israelis do not see global hostility toward Israel translating into a meaningful threat because the Arab reality cancels it out. Therefore, relieving pressure on Hamas makes no sense to the Israelis. Doing so would be as likely to alienate Fatah and Egypt as it would to satisfy the Swedes, for example. As Israel has less interest in the Swedes than in Egypt and Fatah, it proceeds as it has. A single point sums up the story of Israel and the Gaza blockade-runners: Not one Egyptian aircraft threatened the Israeli naval vessels, nor did any Syrian warship approach the intercept point. The Israelis could be certain of complete command of the sea and air without challenge. And this underscores how the Arab countries no longer have a military force that can challenge the Israelis, nor the will nor interest to acquire one. Where Egyptian and Syrian forces posed a profound threat to Israeli forces in 1973, no such threat exists now. Israel has a completely free hand in the region militarily; it does not have to take into account military counteraction. The threat posed by intifada, suicide bombers, rockets from Lebanon and Gaza, and Hezbollah fighters is real, but it does not threaten the survival of Israel the way the threat from Egypt and Syria once did (and the Israelis see actions like the Gaza blockade as actually reducing the threat of intifada, suicide bombers and rockets). Non-state actors simply lack the force needed to reach this threshold. When we search for the reasons behind Israeli actions, it is this singular military fact that explains Israeli decision-making. And while the break between Turkey and Israel is real, Turkey alone cannot bring significant pressure to bear on Israel beyond the sphere of public opinion and diplomacy because of the profound divisions in the region. Turkey has the option to reduce or end cooperation with Israel, but it does not have potential allies in the Arab world it would need against Israel. Israel therefore feels buffered against the Turkish reaction. Though its relationship with Turkey is significant to Israel, it is clearly not significant enough for Israel to give in on the blockade and accept the risks from Gaza. At present, Israel takes the same view of the United States. While the United States became essential to Israeli security after 1967, Israel is far less dependent on the United States today. The quantity of aid the United States supplies Israel has shrunk in significance as the Israeli economy has grown. In the long run, a split with the United States would be significant, but interestingly, in the short run, the Israelis would be able to function quite effectively. Israel does, however, face this strategic problem: In the short run, it has freedom of action, but its actions could change the strategic framework in which it operates over the long run. The most significant threat to Israel is not world opinion; though not trivial, world opinion is not decisive. The threat to Israel is that its actions will generate forces in the Arab world that eventually change the balance of power. The politico-military consequences of public opinion is the key question, and it is in this context that Israel must evaluate its split with Turkey. The most important change for Israel would not be unity among the Palestinians, but a shift in Egyptian policy back toward the position it held prior to Camp David. Egypt is the center of gravity of the Arab world, the largest country and formerly the driving force behind Arab unity. It was the power Israel feared above all others. But Egypt under Mubarak has shifted its stance versus the Palestinians, and far more important, allowed Egypt's military capability to atrophy. Should Mubarak's successor choose to align with these forces and move to rebuild Egypt's military capability, however, Israel would face a very different regional equation. A hostile Turkey aligned with Egypt could speed Egyptian military recovery and create a significant threat to Israel. Turkish sponsorship of Syrian military expansion would increase the pressure further. Imagine a world in which the Egyptians, Syrians and Turks formed a coalition that revived the Arab threat to Israel and the United States returned to its position of the 1950s when it did not materially support Israel, and it becomes clear that Turkey's emerging power combined with a political shift in the Arab world could represent a profound danger to Israel. Where there is no balance of power, the dominant nation can act freely. The problem with this is that doing so tends to force neighbors to try to create a balance of power. Egypt and Syria were not a negligible threat to Israel in the past. It is in Israel's interest to keep them passive. The Israelis can't dismiss the threat that its actions could trigger political processes that cause these countries to revert to prior behavior. They still remember what underestimating Egypt and Syria cost them in 1973. It is remarkable how rapidly military capabilities can revive: Recall that the Egyptian army was shattered in 1967, but by 1973 was able to mount an offensive that frightened Israel quite a bit. The Israelis have the upper hand in the short term. What they must calculate is whether they will retain the upper hand if they continue on their course. Division in the Arab world, including among the Palestinians, cannot disappear overnight, nor can it quickly generate a strategic military threat. But the current configuration of the Arab world is not fixed. Therefore, defusing the current crisis would seem to be a long-term strategic necessity for Israel. Israel's actions have generated shifts in public opinion and diplomacy regionally and globally. The Israelis are calculating that these actions will not generate a long-term shift in the strategic posture of the Arab world. If they are wrong about this, recent actions will have been a significant strategic error. If they are right, then this is simply another passing incident. In the end, the profound divisions in the Arab world both protect Israel and make diplomatic solutions to its challenge almost impossible -- you don't need to fight forces that are so divided, but it is very difficult to negotiate comprehensively with a group that lacks anything approaching a unified voice.

Non-state actors simply lack the force needed to reach this threshold. When we search for the reasons behind Israeli actions, it is this singular military fact that explains Israeli decision-making. And while the break between Turkey and Israel is real, Turkey alone cannot bring significant pressure to bear on Israel beyond the sphere of public opinion and diplomacy because of the profound divisions in the region. Turkey has the option to reduce or end cooperation with Israel, but it does not have potential allies in the Arab world it would need against Israel. Israel therefore feels buffered against the Turkish reaction. Though its relationship with Turkey is significant to Israel, it is clearly not significant enough for Israel to give in on the blockade and accept the risks from Gaza. At present, Israel takes the same view of the United States. While the United States became essential to Israeli security after 1967, Israel is far less dependent on the United States today. The quantity of aid the United States supplies Israel has shrunk in significance as the Israeli economy has grown. In the long run, a split with the United States would be significant, but interestingly, in the short run, the Israelis would be able to function quite effectively. Israel does, however, face this strategic problem: In the short run, it has freedom of action, but its actions could change the strategic framework in which it operates over the long run. The most significant threat to Israel is not world opinion; though not trivial, world opinion is not decisive. The threat to Israel is that its actions will generate forces in the Arab world that eventually change the balance of power. The politico-military consequences of public opinion is the key question, and it is in this context that Israel must evaluate its split with Turkey. The most important change for Israel would not be unity among the Palestinians, but a shift in Egyptian policy back toward the position it held prior to Camp David. Egypt is the center of gravity of the Arab world, the largest country and formerly the driving force behind Arab unity. It was the power Israel feared above all others. But Egypt under Mubarak has shifted its stance versus the Palestinians, and far more important, allowed Egypt's military capability to atrophy. Should Mubarak's successor choose to align with these forces and move to rebuild Egypt's military capability, however, Israel would face a very different regional equation. A hostile Turkey aligned with Egypt could speed Egyptian military recovery and create a significant threat to Israel. Turkish sponsorship of Syrian military expansion would increase the pressure further. Imagine a world in which the Egyptians, Syrians and Turks formed a coalition that revived the Arab threat to Israel and the United States returned to its position of the 1950s when it did not materially support Israel, and it becomes clear that Turkey's emerging power combined with a political shift in the Arab world could represent a profound danger to Israel. Where there is no balance of power, the dominant nation can act freely. The problem with this is that doing so tends to force neighbors to try to create a balance of power. Egypt and Syria were not a negligible threat to Israel in the past. It is in Israel's interest to keep them passive. The Israelis can't dismiss the threat that its actions could trigger political processes that cause these countries to revert to prior behavior. They still remember what underestimating Egypt and Syria cost them in 1973. It is remarkable how rapidly military capabilities can revive: Recall that the Egyptian army was shattered in 1967, but by 1973 was able to mount an offensive that frightened Israel quite a bit. The Israelis have the upper hand in the short term. What they must calculate is whether they will retain the upper hand if they continue on their course. Division in the Arab world, including among the Palestinians, cannot disappear overnight, nor can it quickly generate a strategic military threat. But the current configuration of the Arab world is not fixed. Therefore, defusing the current crisis would seem to be a long-term strategic necessity for Israel. Israel's actions have generated shifts in public opinion and diplomacy regionally and globally. The Israelis are calculating that these actions will not generate a long-term shift in the strategic posture of the Arab world. If they are wrong about this, recent actions will have been a significant strategic error. If they are right, then this is simply another passing incident. In the end, the profound divisions in the Arab world both protect Israel and make diplomatic solutions to its challenge almost impossible -- you don't need to fight forces that are so divided, but it is very difficult to negotiate comprehensively with a group that lacks anything approaching a unified voice.

Turkish-Israeli relations have not quite collapsed since then but are at their lowest level since Israel's founding. U.S.-Israeli tensions have emerged, and European hostility toward Israel continues to intensify.",,ENGLISH,,"December 13, 2012",2438 words,"The question has now become whether substantial consequences will follow from the incident. Put differently, the question is whether and how it will be exploited beyond the arena of public opinion. The most significant threat to Israel would, of course, be military. International criticism is not without significance, but nations do not change direction absent direct threats to their interests. But powers outside the region are unlikely to exert military power against Israel, and even significant economic or political sanctions are unlikely to happen. Apart from the desire of outside powers to limit their involvement, this is rooted in the fact that significant actions are unlikely from inside the region either. The first generations of Israelis lived under the threat of conventional military defeat by neighboring countries. More recent generations still faced threats, but not this one. Israel is operating in an advantageous strategic context save for the arena of public opinion and diplomatic relations and the question of Iranian nuclear weapons. All of these issues are significant, but none is as immediate a threat as the specter of a defeat in conventional warfare had been. Israel's regional enemies are so profoundly divided among themselves and have such divergent relations with Israel that an effective coalition against Israel does not exist -- and is unlikely to arise in the near future. Given this, the probability of an effective, as opposed to rhetorical, shift in the behavior of powers outside the region is unlikely. At every level, Israel's Arab neighbors are incapable of forming even a partial coalition against Israel. Israel is not forced to calibrate its actions with an eye toward regional consequences, explaining Israel's willingness to accept broad international condemnation. Palestinian Divisions To begin to understand how deeply the Arabs are split, simply consider the split among the Palestinians themselves. They are currently divided between two very different and hostile factions. On one side is Fatah, which dominates the West Bank. On the other side is Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip. Aside from the geographic division of the Palestinian territories -- which causes the Palestinians to behave almost as if they comprised two separate and hostile countries -- the two groups have profoundly different ideologies. Fatah arose from the secular, socialist, Arab-nationalist and militarist movement of Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser in the 1950s. Created in the 1960s, Fatah was closely aligned with the Soviet Union. It was the dominant, though far from the only, faction in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The PLO was an umbrella group that brought together the highly fragmented elements of the Palestinian movement. Yasser Arafat long dominated Fatah; his death left Fatah without a charismatic leader, but with a strong bureaucracy increasingly devoid of a coherent ideology or strategy. Hamas arose from the Islamist movement. It was driven by religious motivations quite alien from Fatah and hostile to it. For Hamas, the liberation of Palestine was not simply a nationalist imperative, but also a religious requirement. Hamas was also hostile to what it saw as the financial corruption Arafat brought to the Palestinian movement, as well as to Fatah's secularism. Hamas and Fatah are playing a zero-sum game. Given their inability to form a coalition and their mutual desire for the other to fail, a victory for one is a defeat for the other. This means that whatever public statements Fatah makes, the current international focus on Gaza and Hamas weakens Fatah. And this means that at some point, Fatah will try to undermine the political gains the flotilla has offered Hamas. The Palestinians' deep geographic, ideological and historical divisions occasionally flare up into violence. Their movement has always been split, its single greatest weakness. Though revolutionary movements frequently are torn by sectarianism, these divisions are so deep that even without Israeli manipulation, the threat the Palestinians pose to the Israelis is diminished. With manipulation, the Israelis can pit Fatah against Hamas. The Arab States and the Palestinians The split within the Palestinians is also reflected in divergent opinions among what used to be called the confrontation states surrounding Israel -- Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Egypt, for example, is directly hostile to Hamas, a religious movement amid a sea of essentially secular Arab states. Hamas' roots are in Egypt's largest Islamist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, which the Egyptian state has historically considered its main domestic threat. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's regime has moved aggressively against Egyptian Islamists and sees Hamas' ideology as a threat, as it could spread back to Egypt. For this and other reasons, Egypt has maintained its own blockade of Gaza. Egypt is much closer to Fatah, whose ideology derives from Egyptian secularism, and for this reason, Hamas deeply distrusts Cairo. Jordan views Fatah with deep distrust. In 1970, Fatah under Arafat tried to stage a revolution against the Hashemite monarchy in Jordan. The resulting massacres, referred to as Black September, cost about 10,000 Palestinian lives. Fatah has never truly forgiven Jordan for Black September, and the Jordanians have never really trusted Fatah since then. The idea of an independent Palestinian state on the West Bank unsettles the Hashemite regime, as Jordan's population is mostly Palestinian. Meanwhile, Hamas with its Islamist ideology worries Jordan, which has had its own problems with the Muslim Brotherhood. So rhetoric aside, the Jordanians are uneasy at best with the Palestinians, and despite years of Israeli-Palestinian hostility, Jordan (and Egypt) has a peace treaty with Israel that remains in place. Syria is far more interested in Lebanon than it is in the Palestinians. Its co-sponsorship (along with Iran) of Hezbollah has more to do with Syria's desire to dominate Lebanon than it does with Hezbollah as an anti-Israeli force. Indeed, whenever fighting breaks out between Hezbollah and Israel, the Syrians get nervous and their tensions with Iran increase. And of course, while Hezbollah is anti-Israeli, it is not a Palestinian movement. It is a Lebanese Shiite movement. Most Palestinians are Sunni, and while they share a common goal -- the destruction of Israel -- it is not clear that Hezbollah would want the same kind of regime in Palestine that either Hamas or Fatah would want. So Syria is playing a side game with an anti-Israeli movement that isn't Palestinian, while also maintaining relations with both factions of the Palestinian movement. Outside the confrontation states, the Saudis and other Arabian Peninsula regimes remember the threat that Nasser and the PLO posed to their regimes. They do not easily forgive, and their support for Fatah comes in full awareness of the potential destabilizing influence of the Palestinians. And while the Iranians would love to have influence over the Palestinians, Tehran is more than 1,000 miles away. Sometimes Iranian arms get through to the Palestinians. But Fatah doesn't trust the Iranians, and Hamas, though a religious movement, is Sunni while Iran is Shiite. Hamas and the Iranians may cooperate on some tactical issues, but they do not share the same vision. Israel's Short-term Free Hand and Long-term Challenge Given this environment, it is extremely difficult to translate hostility to Israeli policies in Europe and other areas into meaningful levers against Israel. Under these circumstances, the Israelis see the consequences of actions that excite hostility toward Israel from the Arabs and the rest of the world as less dangerous than losing control of Gaza. The more independent Gaza becomes, the greater the threat it poses to Israel. The suppression of Gaza is much safer and is something Fatah ultimately supports, Egypt participates in, Jordan is relieved by and Syria is ultimately indifferent to. Nations base their actions on risks and rewards. The configuration of the Palestinians and Arabs rewards Israeli assertiveness and provides few rewards for caution. The Israelis do not see global hostility toward Israel translating into a meaningful threat because the Arab reality cancels it out. Therefore, relieving pressure on Hamas makes no sense to the Israelis. Doing so would be as likely to alienate Fatah and Egypt as it would to satisfy the Swedes, for example. As Israel has less interest in the Swedes than in Egypt and Fatah, it proceeds as it has. A single point sums up the story of Israel and the Gaza blockade-runners: Not one Egyptian aircraft threatened the Israeli naval vessels, nor did any Syrian warship approach the intercept point. The Israelis could be certain of complete command of the sea and air without challenge. And this underscores how the Arab countries no longer have a military force that can challenge the Israelis, nor the will nor interest to acquire one. Where Egyptian and Syrian forces posed a profound threat to Israeli forces in 1973, no such threat exists now. Israel has a completely free hand in the region militarily; it does not have to take into account military counteraction. The threat posed by intifada, suicide bombers, rockets from Lebanon and Gaza, and Hezbollah fighters is real, but it does not threaten the survival of Israel the way the threat from Egypt and Syria once did (and the Israelis see actions like the Gaza blockade as actually reducing the threat of intifada, suicide bombers and rockets). Non-state actors simply lack the force needed to reach this threshold. When we search for the reasons behind Israeli actions, it is this singular military fact that explains Israeli decision-making.

Though revolutionary movements frequently are torn by sectarianism, these divisions are so deep that even without Israeli manipulation, the threat the Palestinians pose to the Israelis is diminished. With manipulation, the Israelis can pit Fatah against Hamas. The Arab States and the Palestinians The split within the Palestinians is also reflected in divergent opinions among what used to be called the confrontation states surrounding Israel -- Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Egypt, for example, is directly hostile to Hamas, a religious movement amid a sea of essentially secular Arab states. Hamas' roots are in Egypt's largest Islamist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, which the Egyptian state has historically considered its main domestic threat. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's regime has moved aggressively against Egyptian Islamists and sees Hamas' ideology as a threat, as it could spread back to Egypt. For this and other reasons, Egypt has maintained its own blockade of Gaza. Egypt is much closer to Fatah, whose ideology derives from Egyptian secularism, and for this reason, Hamas deeply distrusts Cairo. Jordan views Fatah with deep distrust. In 1970, Fatah under Arafat tried to stage a revolution against the Hashemite monarchy in Jordan. The resulting massacres, referred to as Black September, cost about 10,000 Palestinian lives. Fatah has never truly forgiven Jordan for Black September, and the Jordanians have never really trusted Fatah since then. The idea of an independent Palestinian state on the West Bank unsettles the Hashemite regime, as Jordan's population is mostly Palestinian. Meanwhile, Hamas with its Islamist ideology worries Jordan, which has had its own problems with the Muslim Brotherhood. So rhetoric aside, the Jordanians are uneasy at best with the Palestinians, and despite years of Israeli-Palestinian hostility, Jordan (and Egypt) has a peace treaty with Israel that remains in place. Syria is far more interested in Lebanon than it is in the Palestinians. Its co-sponsorship (along with Iran) of Hezbollah has more to do with Syria's desire to dominate Lebanon than it does with Hezbollah as an anti-Israeli force. Indeed, whenever fighting breaks out between Hezbollah and Israel, the Syrians get nervous and their tensions with Iran increase. And of course, while Hezbollah is anti-Israeli, it is not a Palestinian movement. It is a Lebanese Shiite movement. Most Palestinians are Sunni, and while they share a common goal -- the destruction of Israel -- it is not clear that Hezbollah would want the same kind of regime in Palestine that either Hamas or Fatah would want. So Syria is playing a side game with an anti-Israeli movement that isn't Palestinian, while also maintaining relations with both factions of the Palestinian movement. Outside the confrontation states, the Saudis and other Arabian Peninsula regimes remember the threat that Nasser and the PLO posed to their regimes. They do not easily forgive, and their support for Fatah comes in full awareness of the potential destabilizing influence of the Palestinians. And while the Iranians would love to have influence over the Palestinians, Tehran is more than 1,000 miles away. Sometimes Iranian arms get through to the Palestinians. But Fatah doesn't trust the Iranians, and Hamas, though a religious movement, is Sunni while Iran is Shiite. Hamas and the Iranians may cooperate on some tactical issues, but they do not share the same vision. Israel's Short-term Free Hand and Long-term Challenge Given this environment, it is extremely difficult to translate hostility to Israeli policies in Europe and other areas into meaningful levers against Israel. Under these circumstances, the Israelis see the consequences of actions that excite hostility toward Israel from the Arabs and the rest of the world as less dangerous than losing control of Gaza. The more independent Gaza becomes, the greater the threat it poses to Israel. The suppression of Gaza is much safer and is something Fatah ultimately supports, Egypt participates in, Jordan is relieved by and Syria is ultimately indifferent to. Nations base their actions on risks and rewards. The configuration of the Palestinians and Arabs rewards Israeli assertiveness and provides few rewards for caution. The Israelis do not see global hostility toward Israel translating into a meaningful threat because the Arab reality cancels it out. Therefore, relieving pressure on Hamas makes no sense to the Israelis. Doing so would be as likely to alienate Fatah and Egypt as it would to satisfy the Swedes, for example. As Israel has less interest in the Swedes than in Egypt and Fatah, it proceeds as it has. A single point sums up the story of Israel and the Gaza blockade-runners: Not one Egyptian aircraft threatened the Israeli naval vessels, nor did any Syrian warship approach the intercept point. The Israelis could be certain of complete command of the sea and air without challenge. And this underscores how the Arab countries no longer have a military force that can challenge the Israelis, nor the will nor interest to acquire one. Where Egyptian and Syrian forces posed a profound threat to Israeli forces in 1973, no such threat exists now. Israel has a completely free hand in the region militarily; it does not have to take into account military counteraction. The threat posed by intifada, suicide bombers, rockets from Lebanon and Gaza, and Hezbollah fighters is real, but it does not threaten the survival of Israel the way the threat from Egypt and Syria once did (and the Israelis see actions like the Gaza blockade as actually reducing the threat of intifada, suicide bombers and rockets). Non-state actors simply lack the force needed to reach this threshold. When we search for the reasons behind Israeli actions, it is this singular military fact that explains Israeli decision-making. And while the break between Turkey and Israel is real, Turkey alone cannot bring significant pressure to bear on Israel beyond the sphere of public opinion and diplomacy because of the profound divisions in the region. Turkey has the option to reduce or end cooperation with Israel, but it does not have potential allies in the Arab world it would need against Israel. Israel therefore feels buffered against the Turkish reaction. Though its relationship with Turkey is significant to Israel, it is clearly not significant enough for Israel to give in on the blockade and accept the risks from Gaza. At present, Israel takes the same view of the United States. While the United States became essential to Israeli security after 1967, Israel is far less dependent on the United States today. The quantity of aid the United States supplies Israel has shrunk in significance as the Israeli economy has grown. In the long run, a split with the United States would be significant, but interestingly, in the short run, the Israelis would be able to function quite effectively. Israel does, however, face this strategic problem: In the short run, it has freedom of action, but its actions could change the strategic framework in which it operates over the long run. The most significant threat to Israel is not world opinion; though not trivial, world opinion is not decisive. The threat to Israel is that its actions will generate forces in the Arab world that eventually change the balance of power. The politico-military consequences of public opinion is the key question, and it is in this context that Israel must evaluate its split with Turkey. The most important change for Israel would not be unity among the Palestinians, but a shift in Egyptian policy back toward the position it held prior to Camp David. Egypt is the center of gravity of the Arab world, the largest country and formerly the driving force behind Arab unity. It was the power Israel feared above all others. But Egypt under Mubarak has shifted its stance versus the Palestinians, and far more important, allowed Egypt's military capability to atrophy. Should Mubarak's successor choose to align with these forces and move to rebuild Egypt's military capability, however, Israel would face a very different regional equation. A hostile Turkey aligned with Egypt could speed Egyptian military recovery and create a significant threat to Israel. Turkish sponsorship of Syrian military expansion would increase the pressure further. Imagine a world in which the Egyptians, Syrians and Turks formed a coalition that revived the Arab threat to Israel and the United States returned to its position of the 1950s when it did not materially support Israel, and it becomes clear that Turkey's emerging power combined with a political shift in the Arab world could represent a profound danger to Israel. Where there is no balance of power, the dominant nation can act freely. The problem with this is that doing so tends to force neighbors to try to create a balance of power. Egypt and Syria were not a negligible threat to Israel in the past. It is in Israel's interest to keep them passive. The Israelis can't dismiss the threat that its actions could trigger political processes that cause these countries to revert to prior behavior. They still remember what underestimating Egypt and Syria cost them in 1973. It is remarkable how rapidly military capabilities can revive: Recall that the Egyptian army was shattered in 1967, but by 1973 was able to mount an offensive that frightened Israel quite a bit. The Israelis have the upper hand in the short term. What they must calculate is whether they will retain the upper hand if they continue on their course. Division in the Arab world, including among the Palestinians, cannot disappear overnight, nor can it quickly generate a strategic military threat. But the current configuration of the Arab world is not fixed. Therefore, defusing the current crisis would seem to be a long-term strategic necessity for Israel. Israel's actions have generated shifts in public opinion and diplomacy regionally and globally. The Israelis are calculating that these actions will not generate a long-term shift in the strategic posture of the Arab world. If they are wrong about this, recent actions will have been a significant strategic error. If they are right, then this is simply another passing incident. In the end, the profound divisions in the Arab world both protect Israel and make diplomatic solutions to its challenge almost impossible -- you don't need to fight forces that are so divided, but it is very difficult to negotiate comprehensively with a group that lacks anything approaching a unified voice.

35,defenceWeb,2010-06-09,"Stratfor: The limits of public opinion: Arabs, Israelis and the strategic balance",,,Newspaper,"HIGHLIGHT: Last week's events off the coast of Israel continue to resonate. Turkish-Israeli relations have not quite collapsed since then but are at their lowest level since Israel's founding. U.S.-Israeli tensions have emerged, and European hostility toward Israel continues to intensify.",,ENGLISH,,"December 10, 2012",2438 words,"The question has now become whether substantial consequences will follow from the incident. Put differently, the question is whether and how it will be exploited beyond the arena of public opinion. The most significant threat to Israel would, of course, be military. International criticism is not without significance, but nations do not change direction absent direct threats to their interests. But powers outside the region are unlikely to exert military power against Israel, and even significant economic or political sanctions are unlikely to happen. Apart from the desire of outside powers to limit their involvement, this is rooted in the fact that significant actions are unlikely from inside the region either. The first generations of Israelis lived under the threat of conventional military defeat by neighboring countries. More recent generations still faced threats, but not this one. Israel is operating in an advantageous strategic context save for the arena of public opinion and diplomatic relations and the question of Iranian nuclear weapons. All of these issues are significant, but none is as immediate a threat as the specter of a defeat in conventional warfare had been. Israel's regional enemies are so profoundly divided among themselves and have such divergent relations with Israel that an effective coalition against Israel does not exist -- and is unlikely to arise in the near future. Given this, the probability of an effective, as opposed to rhetorical, shift in the behavior of powers outside the region is unlikely. At every level, Israel's Arab neighbors are incapable of forming even a partial coalition against Israel. Israel is not forced to calibrate its actions with an eye toward regional consequences, explaining Israel's willingness to accept broad international condemnation. Palestinian Divisions To begin to understand how deeply the Arabs are split, simply consider the split among the Palestinians themselves. They are currently divided between two very different and hostile factions. On one side is Fatah, which dominates the West Bank. On the other side is Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip. Aside from the geographic division of the Palestinian territories -- which causes the Palestinians to behave almost as if they comprised two separate and hostile countries -- the two groups have profoundly different ideologies. Fatah arose from the secular, socialist, Arab-nationalist and militarist movement of Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser in the 1950s. Created in the 1960s, Fatah was closely aligned with the Soviet Union. It was the dominant, though far from the only, faction in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The PLO was an umbrella group that brought together the highly fragmented elements of the Palestinian movement. Yasser Arafat long dominated Fatah; his death left Fatah without a charismatic leader, but with a strong bureaucracy increasingly devoid of a coherent ideology or strategy. Hamas arose from the Islamist movement. It was driven by religious motivations quite alien from Fatah and hostile to it. For Hamas, the liberation of Palestine was not simply a nationalist imperative, but also a religious requirement. Hamas was also hostile to what it saw as the financial corruption Arafat brought to the Palestinian movement, as well as to Fatah's secularism. Hamas and Fatah are playing a zero-sum game. Given their inability to form a coalition and their mutual desire for the other to fail, a victory for one is a defeat for the other. This means that whatever public statements Fatah makes, the current international focus on Gaza and Hamas weakens Fatah. And this means that at some point, Fatah will try to undermine the political gains the flotilla has offered Hamas. The Palestinians' deep geographic, ideological and historical divisions occasionally flare up into violence. Their movement has always been split, its single greatest weakness. Though revolutionary movements frequently are torn by sectarianism, these divisions are so deep that even without Israeli manipulation, the threat the Palestinians pose to the Israelis is diminished. With manipulation, the Israelis can pit Fatah against Hamas.

Turkish-Israeli relations have not quite collapsed since then but are at their lowest level since Israel's founding. U.S.-Israeli tensions have emerged, and European hostility toward Israel continues to intensify.",,ENGLISH,,"December 8, 2012",2438 words,"The question has now become whether substantial consequences will follow from the incident. Put differently, the question is whether and how it will be exploited beyond the arena of public opinion. The most significant threat to Israel would, of course, be military. International criticism is not without significance, but nations do not change direction absent direct threats to their interests. But powers outside the region are unlikely to exert military power against Israel, and even significant economic or political sanctions are unlikely to happen. Apart from the desire of outside powers to limit their involvement, this is rooted in the fact that significant actions are unlikely from inside the region either. The first generations of Israelis lived under the threat of conventional military defeat by neighboring countries. More recent generations still faced threats, but not this one. Israel is operating in an advantageous strategic context save for the arena of public opinion and diplomatic relations and the question of Iranian nuclear weapons. All of these issues are significant, but none is as immediate a threat as the specter of a defeat in conventional warfare had been. Israel's regional enemies are so profoundly divided among themselves and have such divergent relations with Israel that an effective coalition against Israel does not exist -- and is unlikely to arise in the near future. Given this, the probability of an effective, as opposed to rhetorical, shift in the behavior of powers outside the region is unlikely. At every level, Israel's Arab neighbors are incapable of forming even a partial coalition against Israel. Israel is not forced to calibrate its actions with an eye toward regional consequences, explaining Israel's willingness to accept broad international condemnation. Palestinian Divisions To begin to understand how deeply the Arabs are split, simply consider the split among the Palestinians themselves. They are currently divided between two very different and hostile factions. On one side is Fatah, which dominates the West Bank. On the other side is Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip. Aside from the geographic division of the Palestinian territories -- which causes the Palestinians to behave almost as if they comprised two separate and hostile countries -- the two groups have profoundly different ideologies. Fatah arose from the secular, socialist, Arab-nationalist and militarist movement of Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser in the 1950s. Created in the 1960s, Fatah was closely aligned with the Soviet Union. It was the dominant, though far from the only, faction in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The PLO was an umbrella group that brought together the highly fragmented elements of the Palestinian movement. Yasser Arafat long dominated Fatah; his death left Fatah without a charismatic leader, but with a strong bureaucracy increasingly devoid of a coherent ideology or strategy. Hamas arose from the Islamist movement. It was driven by religious motivations quite alien from Fatah and hostile to it. For Hamas, the liberation of Palestine was not simply a nationalist imperative, but also a religious requirement. Hamas was also hostile to what it saw as the financial corruption Arafat brought to the Palestinian movement, as well as to Fatah's secularism. Hamas and Fatah are playing a zero-sum game. Given their inability to form a coalition and their mutual desire for the other to fail, a victory for one is a defeat for the other. This means that whatever public statements Fatah makes, the current international focus on Gaza and Hamas weakens Fatah. And this means that at some point, Fatah will try to undermine the political gains the flotilla has offered Hamas. The Palestinians' deep geographic, ideological and historical divisions occasionally flare up into violence. Their movement has always been split, its single greatest weakness. Though revolutionary movements frequently are torn by sectarianism, these divisions are so deep that even without Israeli manipulation, the threat the Palestinians pose to the Israelis is diminished. With manipulation, the Israelis can pit Fatah against Hamas. The Arab States and the Palestinians The split within the Palestinians is also reflected in divergent opinions among what used to be called the confrontation states surrounding Israel -- Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Egypt, for example, is directly hostile to Hamas, a religious movement amid a sea of essentially secular Arab states. Hamas' roots are in Egypt's largest Islamist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, which the Egyptian state has historically considered its main domestic threat. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's regime has moved aggressively against Egyptian Islamists and sees Hamas' ideology as a threat, as it could spread back to Egypt. For this and other reasons, Egypt has maintained its own blockade of Gaza. Egypt is much closer to Fatah, whose ideology derives from Egyptian secularism, and for this reason, Hamas deeply distrusts Cairo. Jordan views Fatah with deep distrust. In 1970, Fatah under Arafat tried to stage a revolution against the Hashemite monarchy in Jordan. The resulting massacres, referred to as Black September, cost about 10,000 Palestinian lives. Fatah has never truly forgiven Jordan for Black September, and the Jordanians have never really trusted Fatah since then. The idea of an independent Palestinian state on the West Bank unsettles the Hashemite regime, as Jordan's population is mostly Palestinian. Meanwhile, Hamas with its Islamist ideology worries Jordan, which has had its own problems with the Muslim Brotherhood. So rhetoric aside, the Jordanians are uneasy at best with the Palestinians, and despite years of Israeli-Palestinian hostility, Jordan (and Egypt) has a peace treaty with Israel that remains in place. Syria is far more interested in Lebanon than it is in the Palestinians. Its co-sponsorship (along with Iran) of Hezbollah has more to do with Syria's desire to dominate Lebanon than it does with Hezbollah as an anti-Israeli force. Indeed, whenever fighting breaks out between Hezbollah and Israel, the Syrians get nervous and their tensions with Iran increase. And of course, while Hezbollah is anti-Israeli, it is not a Palestinian movement. It is a Lebanese Shiite movement. Most Palestinians are Sunni, and while they share a common goal -- the destruction of Israel -- it is not clear that Hezbollah would want the same kind of regime in Palestine that either Hamas or Fatah would want. So Syria is playing a side game with an anti-Israeli movement that isn't Palestinian, while also maintaining relations with both factions of the Palestinian movement. Outside the confrontation states, the Saudis and other Arabian Peninsula regimes remember the threat that Nasser and the PLO posed to their regimes. They do not easily forgive, and their support for Fatah comes in full awareness of the potential destabilizing influence of the Palestinians. And while the Iranians would love to have influence over the Palestinians, Tehran is more than 1,000 miles away. Sometimes Iranian arms get through to the Palestinians. But Fatah doesn't trust the Iranians, and Hamas, though a religious movement, is Sunni while Iran is Shiite. Hamas and the Iranians may cooperate on some tactical issues, but they do not share the same vision. Israel's Short-term Free Hand and Long-term Challenge Given this environment, it is extremely difficult to translate hostility to Israeli policies in Europe and other areas into meaningful levers against Israel. Under these circumstances, the Israelis see the consequences of actions that excite hostility toward Israel from the Arabs and the rest of the world as less dangerous than losing control of Gaza. The more independent Gaza becomes, the greater the threat it poses to Israel. The suppression of Gaza is much safer and is something Fatah ultimately supports, Egypt participates in, Jordan is relieved by and Syria is ultimately indifferent to. Nations base their actions on risks and rewards. The configuration of the Palestinians and Arabs rewards Israeli assertiveness and provides few rewards for caution. The Israelis do not see global hostility toward Israel translating into a meaningful threat because the Arab reality cancels it out. Therefore, relieving pressure on Hamas makes no sense to the Israelis. Doing so would be as likely to alienate Fatah and Egypt as it would to satisfy the Swedes, for example. As Israel has less interest in the Swedes than in Egypt and Fatah, it proceeds as it has. A single point sums up the story of Israel and the Gaza blockade-runners: Not one Egyptian aircraft threatened the Israeli naval vessels, nor did any Syrian warship approach the intercept point. The Israelis could be certain of complete command of the sea and air without challenge. And this underscores how the Arab countries no longer have a military force that can challenge the Israelis, nor the will nor interest to acquire one. Where Egyptian and Syrian forces posed a profound threat to Israeli forces in 1973, no such threat exists now. Israel has a completely free hand in the region militarily; it does not have to take into account military counteraction. The threat posed by intifada, suicide bombers, rockets from Lebanon and Gaza, and Hezbollah fighters is real, but it does not threaten the survival of Israel the way the threat from Egypt and Syria once did (and the Israelis see actions like the Gaza blockade as actually reducing the threat of intifada, suicide bombers and rockets). Non-state actors simply lack the force needed to reach this threshold. When we search for the reasons behind Israeli actions, it is this singular military fact that explains Israeli decision-making. And while the break between Turkey and Israel is real, Turkey alone cannot bring significant pressure to bear on Israel beyond the sphere of public opinion and diplomacy because of the profound divisions in the region. Turkey has the option to reduce or end cooperation with Israel, but it does not have potential allies in the Arab world it would need against Israel. Israel therefore feels buffered against the Turkish reaction. Though its relationship with Turkey is significant to Israel, it is clearly not significant enough for Israel to give in on the blockade and accept the risks from Gaza. At present, Israel takes the same view of the United States. While the United States became essential to Israeli security after 1967, Israel is far less dependent on the United States today. The quantity of aid the United States supplies Israel has shrunk in significance as the Israeli economy has grown. In the long run, a split with the United States would be significant, but interestingly, in the short run, the Israelis would be able to function quite effectively. Israel does, however, face this strategic problem: In the short run, it has freedom of action, but its actions could change the strategic framework in which it operates over the long run. The most significant threat to Israel is not world opinion; though not trivial, world opinion is not decisive. The threat to Israel is that its actions will generate forces in the Arab world that eventually change the balance of power. The politico-military consequences of public opinion is the key question, and it is in this context that Israel must evaluate its split with Turkey. The most important change for Israel would not be unity among the Palestinians, but a shift in Egyptian policy back toward the position it held prior to Camp David. Egypt is the center of gravity of the Arab world, the largest country and formerly the driving force behind Arab unity. It was the power Israel feared above all others. But Egypt under Mubarak has shifted its stance versus the Palestinians, and far more important, allowed Egypt's military capability to atrophy. Should Mubarak's successor choose to align with these forces and move to rebuild Egypt's military capability, however, Israel would face a very different regional equation. A hostile Turkey aligned with Egypt could speed Egyptian military recovery and create a significant threat to Israel. Turkish sponsorship of Syrian military expansion would increase the pressure further. Imagine a world in which the Egyptians, Syrians and Turks formed a coalition that revived the Arab threat to Israel and the United States returned to its position of the 1950s when it did not materially support Israel, and it becomes clear that Turkey's emerging power combined with a political shift in the Arab world could represent a profound danger to Israel. Where there is no balance of power, the dominant nation can act freely. The problem with this is that doing so tends to force neighbors to try to create a balance of power. Egypt and Syria were not a negligible threat to Israel in the past. It is in Israel's interest to keep them passive. The Israelis can't dismiss the threat that its actions could trigger political processes that cause these countries to revert to prior behavior. They still remember what underestimating Egypt and Syria cost them in 1973. It is remarkable how rapidly military capabilities can revive: Recall that the Egyptian army was shattered in 1967, but by 1973 was able to mount an offensive that frightened Israel quite a bit. The Israelis have the upper hand in the short term. What they must calculate is whether they will retain the upper hand if they continue on their course.

The more independent Gaza becomes, the greater the threat it poses to Israel. The suppression of Gaza is much safer and is something Fatah ultimately supports, Egypt participates in, Jordan is relieved by and Syria is ultimately indifferent to. Nations base their actions on risks and rewards. The configuration of the Palestinians and Arabs rewards Israeli assertiveness and provides few rewards for caution. The Israelis do not see global hostility toward Israel translating into a meaningful threat because the Arab reality cancels it out. Therefore, relieving pressure on Hamas makes no sense to the Israelis. Doing so would be as likely to alienate Fatah and Egypt as it would to satisfy the Swedes, for example. As Israel has less interest in the Swedes than in Egypt and Fatah, it proceeds as it has. A single point sums up the story of Israel and the Gaza blockade-runners: Not one Egyptian aircraft threatened the Israeli naval vessels, nor did any Syrian warship approach the intercept point. The Israelis could be certain of complete command of the sea and air without challenge. And this underscores how the Arab countries no longer have a military force that can challenge the Israelis, nor the will nor interest to acquire one. Where Egyptian and Syrian forces posed a profound threat to Israeli forces in 1973, no such threat exists now. Israel has a completely free hand in the region militarily; it does not have to take into account military counteraction. The threat posed by intifada, suicide bombers, rockets from Lebanon and Gaza, and Hezbollah fighters is real, but it does not threaten the survival of Israel the way the threat from Egypt and Syria once did (and the Israelis see actions like the Gaza blockade as actually reducing the threat of intifada, suicide bombers and rockets). Non-state actors simply lack the force needed to reach this threshold. When we search for the reasons behind Israeli actions, it is this singular military fact that explains Israeli decision-making. And while the break between Turkey and Israel is real, Turkey alone cannot bring significant pressure to bear on Israel beyond the sphere of public opinion and diplomacy because of the profound divisions in the region. Turkey has the option to reduce or end cooperation with Israel, but it does not have potential allies in the Arab world it would need against Israel. Israel therefore feels buffered against the Turkish reaction. Though its relationship with Turkey is significant to Israel, it is clearly not significant enough for Israel to give in on the blockade and accept the risks from Gaza. At present, Israel takes the same view of the United States. While the United States became essential to Israeli security after 1967, Israel is far less dependent on the United States today. The quantity of aid the United States supplies Israel has shrunk in significance as the Israeli economy has grown. In the long run, a split with the United States would be significant, but interestingly, in the short run, the Israelis would be able to function quite effectively. Israel does, however, face this strategic problem: In the short run, it has freedom of action, but its actions could change the strategic framework in which it operates over the long run. The most significant threat to Israel is not world opinion; though not trivial, world opinion is not decisive. The threat to Israel is that its actions will generate forces in the Arab world that eventually change the balance of power. The politico-military consequences of public opinion is the key question, and it is in this context that Israel must evaluate its split with Turkey. The most important change for Israel would not be unity among the Palestinians, but a shift in Egyptian policy back toward the position it held prior to Camp David. Egypt is the center of gravity of the Arab world, the largest country and formerly the driving force behind Arab unity. It was the power Israel feared above all others. But Egypt under Mubarak has shifted its stance versus the Palestinians, and far more important, allowed Egypt's military capability to atrophy. Should Mubarak's successor choose to align with these forces and move to rebuild Egypt's military capability, however, Israel would face a very different regional equation. A hostile Turkey aligned with Egypt could speed Egyptian military recovery and create a significant threat to Israel. Turkish sponsorship of Syrian military expansion would increase the pressure further. Imagine a world in which the Egyptians, Syrians and Turks formed a coalition that revived the Arab threat to Israel and the United States returned to its position of the 1950s when it did not materially support Israel, and it becomes clear that Turkey's emerging power combined with a political shift in the Arab world could represent a profound danger to Israel. Where there is no balance of power, the dominant nation can act freely. The problem with this is that doing so tends to force neighbors to try to create a balance of power. Egypt and Syria were not a negligible threat to Israel in the past. It is in Israel's interest to keep them passive. The Israelis can't dismiss the threat that its actions could trigger political processes that cause these countries to revert to prior behavior. They still remember what underestimating Egypt and Syria cost them in 1973. It is remarkable how rapidly military capabilities can revive: Recall that the Egyptian army was shattered in 1967, but by 1973 was able to mount an offensive that frightened Israel quite a bit. The Israelis have the upper hand in the short term. What they must calculate is whether they will retain the upper hand if they continue on their course. Division in the Arab world, including among the Palestinians, cannot disappear overnight, nor can it quickly generate a strategic military threat. But the current configuration of the Arab world is not fixed. Therefore, defusing the current crisis would seem to be a long-term strategic necessity for Israel. Israel's actions have generated shifts in public opinion and diplomacy regionally and globally. The Israelis are calculating that these actions will not generate a long-term shift in the strategic posture of the Arab world. If they are wrong about this, recent actions will have been a significant strategic error. If they are right, then this is simply another passing incident. In the end, the profound divisions in the Arab world both protect Israel and make diplomatic solutions to its challenge almost impossible -- you don't need to fight forces that are so divided, but it is very difficult to negotiate comprehensively with a group that lacks anything approaching a unified voice.

40,defenceWeb,2010-06-09,"Stratfor: The limits of public opinion: Arabs, Israelis and the strategic balance",,,Newspaper,"HIGHLIGHT: Last week's events off the coast of Israel continue to resonate. Turkish-Israeli relations have not quite collapsed since then but are at their lowest level since Israel's founding. U.S.-Israeli tensions have emerged, and European hostility toward Israel continues to intensify.",,ENGLISH,,"December 4, 2012",2438 words,"The question has now become whether substantial consequences will follow from the incident. Put differently, the question is whether and how it will be exploited beyond the arena of public opinion. The most significant threat to Israel would, of course, be military. International criticism is not without significance, but nations do not change direction absent direct threats to their interests. But powers outside the region are unlikely to exert military power against Israel, and even significant economic or political sanctions are unlikely to happen. Apart from the desire of outside powers to limit their involvement, this is rooted in the fact that significant actions are unlikely from inside the region either. The first generations of Israelis lived under the threat of conventional military defeat by neighboring countries. More recent generations still faced threats, but not this one. Israel is operating in an advantageous strategic context save for the arena of public opinion and diplomatic relations and the question of Iranian nuclear weapons. All of these issues are significant, but none is as immediate a threat as the specter of a defeat in conventional warfare had been. Israel's regional enemies are so profoundly divided among themselves and have such divergent relations with Israel that an effective coalition against Israel does not exist -- and is unlikely to arise in the near future. Given this, the probability of an effective, as opposed to rhetorical, shift in the behavior of powers outside the region is unlikely. At every level, Israel's Arab neighbors are incapable of forming even a partial coalition against Israel. Israel is not forced to calibrate its actions with an eye toward regional consequences, explaining Israel's willingness to accept broad international condemnation. Palestinian Divisions To begin to understand how deeply the Arabs are split, simply consider the split among the Palestinians themselves. They are currently divided between two very different and hostile factions. On one side is Fatah, which dominates the West Bank. On the other side is Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip. Aside from the geographic division of the Palestinian territories -- which causes the Palestinians to behave almost as if they comprised two separate and hostile countries -- the two groups have profoundly different ideologies. Fatah arose from the secular, socialist, Arab-nationalist and militarist movement of Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser in the 1950s. Created in the 1960s, Fatah was closely aligned with the Soviet Union. It was the dominant, though far from the only, faction in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The PLO was an umbrella group that brought together the highly fragmented elements of the Palestinian movement. Yasser Arafat long dominated Fatah; his death left Fatah without a charismatic leader, but with a strong bureaucracy increasingly devoid of a coherent ideology or strategy. Hamas arose from the Islamist movement. It was driven by religious motivations quite alien from Fatah and hostile to it. For Hamas, the liberation of Palestine was not simply a nationalist imperative, but also a religious requirement. Hamas was also hostile to what it saw as the financial corruption Arafat brought to the Palestinian movement, as well as to Fatah's secularism. Hamas and Fatah are playing a zero-sum game. Given their inability to form a coalition and their mutual desire for the other to fail, a victory for one is a defeat for the other. This means that whatever public statements Fatah makes, the current international focus on Gaza and Hamas weakens Fatah. And this means that at some point, Fatah will try to undermine the political gains the flotilla has offered Hamas. The Palestinians' deep geographic, ideological and historical divisions occasionally flare up into violence. Their movement has always been split, its single greatest weakness. Though revolutionary movements frequently are torn by sectarianism, these divisions are so deep that even without Israeli manipulation, the threat the Palestinians pose to the Israelis is diminished. With manipulation, the Israelis can pit Fatah against Hamas. The Arab States and the Palestinians The split within the Palestinians is also reflected in divergent opinions among what used to be called the confrontation states surrounding Israel -- Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Egypt, for example, is directly hostile to Hamas, a religious movement amid a sea of essentially secular Arab states. Hamas' roots are in Egypt's largest Islamist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, which the Egyptian state has historically considered its main domestic threat. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's regime has moved aggressively against Egyptian Islamists and sees Hamas' ideology as a threat, as it could spread back to Egypt. For this and other reasons, Egypt has maintained its own blockade of Gaza. Egypt is much closer to Fatah, whose ideology derives from Egyptian secularism, and for this reason, Hamas deeply distrusts Cairo. Jordan views Fatah with deep distrust. In 1970, Fatah under Arafat tried to stage a revolution against the Hashemite monarchy in Jordan. The resulting massacres, referred to as Black September, cost about 10,000 Palestinian lives. Fatah has never truly forgiven Jordan for Black September, and the Jordanians have never really trusted Fatah since then. The idea of an independent Palestinian state on the West Bank unsettles the Hashemite regime, as Jordan's population is mostly Palestinian. Meanwhile, Hamas with its Islamist ideology worries Jordan, which has had its own problems with the Muslim Brotherhood. So rhetoric aside, the Jordanians are uneasy at best with the Palestinians, and despite years of Israeli-Palestinian hostility, Jordan (and Egypt) has a peace treaty with Israel that remains in place. Syria is far more interested in Lebanon than it is in the Palestinians. Its co-sponsorship (along with Iran) of Hezbollah has more to do with Syria's desire to dominate Lebanon than it does with Hezbollah as an anti-Israeli force. Indeed, whenever fighting breaks out between Hezbollah and Israel, the Syrians get nervous and their tensions with Iran increase. And of course, while Hezbollah is anti-Israeli, it is not a Palestinian movement. It is a Lebanese Shiite movement. Most Palestinians are Sunni, and while they share a common goal -- the destruction of Israel -- it is not clear that Hezbollah would want the same kind of regime in Palestine that either Hamas or Fatah would want. So Syria is playing a side game with an anti-Israeli movement that isn't Palestinian, while also maintaining relations with both factions of the Palestinian movement. Outside the confrontation states, the Saudis and other Arabian Peninsula regimes remember the threat that Nasser and the PLO posed to their regimes. They do not easily forgive, and their support for Fatah comes in full awareness of the potential destabilizing influence of the Palestinians. And while the Iranians would love to have influence over the Palestinians, Tehran is more than 1,000 miles away. Sometimes Iranian arms get through to the Palestinians. But Fatah doesn't trust the Iranians, and Hamas, though a religious movement, is Sunni while Iran is Shiite. Hamas and the Iranians may cooperate on some tactical issues, but they do not share the same vision. Israel's Short-term Free Hand and Long-term Challenge Given this environment, it is extremely difficult to translate hostility to Israeli policies in Europe and other areas into meaningful levers against Israel. Under these circumstances, the Israelis see the consequences of actions that excite hostility toward Israel from the Arabs and the rest of the world as less dangerous than losing control of Gaza. The more independent Gaza becomes, the greater the threat it poses to Israel. The suppression of Gaza is much safer and is something Fatah ultimately supports, Egypt participates in, Jordan is relieved by and Syria is ultimately indifferent to. Nations base their actions on risks and rewards. The configuration of the Palestinians and Arabs rewards Israeli assertiveness and provides few rewards for caution. The Israelis do not see global hostility toward Israel translating into a meaningful threat because the Arab reality cancels it out. Therefore, relieving pressure on Hamas makes no sense to the Israelis. Doing so would be as likely to alienate Fatah and Egypt as it would to satisfy the Swedes, for example. As Israel has less interest in the Swedes than in Egypt and Fatah, it proceeds as it has. A single point sums up the story of Israel and the Gaza blockade-runners: Not one Egyptian aircraft threatened the Israeli naval vessels, nor did any Syrian warship approach the intercept point.

42,BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-10-18,Syrian MP says president's Saudi visit aimed at improving ties - Al-Jazeera,,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"October 18, 2010",,"Doha Al-Jazeera Satellite Channel Television in Arabic at 1307 gmt on 17 October carries the following announcer-read report: ""Syrian President Bashar al-Asad will arrive in Saudi Arabia today where he will meet Saudi King Abdallah Bin-Abd-al-Aziz to discuss various regional and international issues, particularly the current situation in Lebanon. Al-Asad's visit comes only one day after the Iranian President Ahmadinezhad's visit to Lebanon, which triggered controversy inside and outside Lebanon. The Saudi king visited Damascus for two days last July, after which he travelled to Lebanon with the Syrian president in a visit that was described as historic."" Immediately afterward, Al-Jazeera carries a three-minute video report by Al-Jazeera reporter Mahmud Al-Jaza'iri. Showing archival footage of the Syrian president and the Saudi monarch, A-Jaza'iri says: ""Syrian President Bashar al-Asad's visit to Saudi Arabia shows the significance of the regional role that Damascus and Riyadh can play in finding solutions to inter-Arab and regional issues. This is the second visit Al-Asad pays to the kingdom in one year, and the two leaders' talks will address means of enhancing bilateral relations, as well as regional and international issues."" Al-Jaza'iri notes expectations that the two leaders will specifically address ""tension in Lebanon,"" the Iraqi government formation, and the peace talks in light of the ""continued Israeli attacks on Palestinians."" At 1310 gmt, Al-Jazeera carries a three-minute live satellite interview with Sa'ir Qudsiyah, member of the Foreign Relations Committee at the Syrian People's Assembly, from Damascus. Asked about the topics the Syrian president will raise during his visit to Saudi Arabia, Qudsiyah says: ""Undoubtedly, the visit will mainly address means of enhancing and improving Syrian-Saudi relations,"" including what he says economic, trade, and cultural ones, in addition to political issues on the Arab, regional, and international fronts. On the significance of the visit in dealing with the Lebanese issue, Qudsiyah says: ""The visit aims to complement the three-way summit which convened Syrian President Bashar al-Asad, his excellency the Lebanese president, and the Saudi king on 5 September."" Al-Jazeera anchor notes: ""Countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia have reservations about the nature of relations between Damascus and Tehran. How can Damascus reassure these countries that its relations with Iran will not be at the expense of, or harm, these countries' interests?"" Qudsiyah says: ""On the contrary, Syrian-Iranian relations are based on mutual respect and common interests. Besides, Iran has positive stances on the main Arab issue; the Palestinian issue, and it supported the Lebanese people in their distress."" Al-Jazeera leads its 1800 gmt and 1900 gmt newscasts with a report saying: "" Syrian President Bashar al-Asad held talks with Saudi King Abdallah Bin-Abd-al-Aziz in Riyadh this evening. The two leaders discussed a number of regional and international issues, on top of which are the files of Palestine, Lebanon, and Iraq. Al-Asad left for his country at a later time.""

43,BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-10-24,Rival camps maintain truce on tribunal for Lebanon rhetoric,,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"October 24, 2010",,"Text of report in English by privately-owned Lebanese newspaper The Daily Star website on 24 October Beirut: Rival Lebanese parties largely upheld an agreement to halt the war of words over the disputed issue of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) Friday [22 October] in a bid to ease tensions pending further regional and internal talks. In line with Lebanese efforts to put an end to the standoff between Prime Minister Sa'd al-Hariri's coalition and Hezbollah, Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) leader MP Walid Jumblatt is scheduled to hold talks Sunday with Syrian President Bashar al-Asad in Damascus. Jumblatt's visit follows discussions this week between Speaker Nabih Birri and Al-Asad, during which the latter encouraged Birri to broker a compromise between Al-Hariri and Hezbollah, Birri's spokesman said. PSP official and Transport Minister Ghazi al-Aridi told The Daily Star Friday that despite the positive climate between Syria and Saudi Arabia, a ""profound crisis of trust"" existed between Hezbollah and Al-Hariri. However, in surprise statements that followed Sunday's Syrian-Saudi summit that reportedly led to an agreement to preserve stability in Lebanon, Syrian Prime Minister Muhammad Naji al-Itri said that the 14 March coalition was a house of cards. ""We do not take into consideration 14, 15 or 16 since those are a house of cards but we look at the Lebanese people, the security of Syria and Lebanon as well as strategic ties between both countries,"" Al-Itri said in remarks to be published by the daily Kuwaiti al-Ra'y. Asked whether threats by Syria's ally in Lebanon to turn the tables to counter the STL indictment embarrassed Damascus amid a Syrian-Saudi agreement to preserve stability in Lebanon, Al-Itri said Syria deals with the Lebanese state rather than with political parties. Al-Itri added that Syria had agreed with President Michel Sulayman on guidelines for bilateral relations, which are being followed. ""Whereas disputes between Lebanese parties fade away since the case between Lebanese parties is that they disagree and fight in the morning and get together at night to smoke the hookah,"" Al-Itri said. But the US assistant secretary of state for Middle Eastern Affairs, Jeffrey Feltman, said Hezbollah, an ally of Syria, sought to impose on the Lebanese a choice between stability and justice. Feltman said statements by Hezbollah, and not the STL, were behind the rise in instability in Lebanon. Phalange Party leader Amin al-Jumayyil told The Daily Star that neither the Lebanese nor Arab states could influence the course of the STL while the country could fall into an abyss due to Hezbollah's negative position. Hezbollah has condemned the STL as an ""Israeli project,"" saying the UN-backed tribunal has fabricated an indictment falsely accusing its members of involvement in the murder of former Premier Rafik al-Hariri in attempt to target the resistance. Tyre MP Nawaf Musawi, a Hezbollah official, said his party would regard those who support the STL indictment as ""Zionist aggressors"" and would face the same fate as Israeli occupiers. In remarks published by the daily pan-Arab Al-Hayat Friday, Feltman said that an absence of justice would lead to instability, arguing against the idea that instability and justice were mutually exclusive. Feltman said Hezbollah and other groups were seeking to impose such a choice on the Lebanese. Source: The Daily Star website, Beirut, in English 24 Oct 10"
44,The Jerusalem Post,2010-04-27,"Barreling on, regardless",,,Newspaper,"HIGHLIGHT: While the president and his advisers are concerned that, for the first time in 80 years, many American Jews may abandon the Democratic Party, they are unwilling to pay even the slightest substantive price to keep them loyal. Our World.",,ENGLISH,OPINION; Pg. 15,"April 29, 2010",1844 words,"If safeguarding international security is the chief aim of US President Barack Obama's foreign policy, then at some point he can be expected to change course in the Middle East. For today, Obama faces the wreckage of every aspect of his Middle East policies. And largely as a consequence of his policies, the region moves ever closer to war. In Iraq, Obama's pledge to withdraw all combat forces from the country by the summer has emboldened the various forces vying for control of the country to set it ablaze once more. In Afghanistan, Obama's surge and leave policy has left would-be US allies hedging their bets, at best. And it has caused the US's NATO partners to question the purpose of their deployment in that country. Then there is Iran. Last week's report by The New York Times that this January Defense Secretary Robert Gates penned a memo to National Security Advisor James Jones warning that the Obama administration has no effective policy for dealing with Iran's nuclear weapons program exposed the bitter truth that in the face of the most acute foreign policy problem they face, Obama and his crew are out to lunch. Gates's attempt to mitigate the story's impact by claiming that actually, the White House is weighing all its options only made things worse. Even before the ink on his correction note was dry, his Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy was telling reporters in Singapore that the military option, ""is not on the table in the near term."" Iran for its part continues to escalate its menacing behavior. Last week its naval forces reportedly interdicted a French ship and an Italian ship navigating through the Straits of Hormuz. President Shimon Peres's announcement last week that Syria has transferred Scud missiles to Hizbullah in Lebanon was a sharp warning that Iran and its underlings are diligently preparing for war with Israel. It also demonstrated that the Obama administration's attempts to use diplomacy to coddle Syria away from Iran have failed completely. Administration officials' statements in the wake of Peres's bombshell make clear that Syria's bellicose actions have not caused the US President to reconsider his failed policy. Obama's advisers responded to the news by irrelevantly boasting that their policy of ""engagement"" enabled them to bring the matter up with their Syrian interlocutors three times before Peres's announcement and once more after he made the statement. AND THAT'S not nearly the end of it. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced last week, soon the Obama administration will expand its dialogue with Syria by returning the US ambassador to Damascus for the first time since Syrian President Bashar Assad ordered the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri five years ago. That is, Obama has chosen to respond to Syria's open brinkmanship by rewarding Assad with newfound legitimacy and panache. And that's still not the worst of it. What is worst is that Obama's advisers openly admit that they have no idea why Syria remains a rogue state despite their happy talk. As one administration official told Foreign Policy, understanding why Syria - Iran's Arab client state - is acting like Iran's Arab client state is, ""the million dollar question."" ""We do not understand Syrian intentions. No one does, and until we get to that question we can never get to the root of the problem,"" the official told the magazine. But while they wait for the Oracle at Damascus to decode itself, they are content to continue wooing Assad as he provokes war. Then there are the Palestinians. After rejecting Obama's envoy George Mitchell's latest plea to conduct indirect negotiations with Israel, Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas explained that Obama's own statements have convinced the Palestinians that there is nothing to negotiate about. As he put it, ""Since you, Mr. President, and you, the members of the American administration, believe in [the urgent need for a Palestinian state] it is your duty to call for the steps in order to reach the solution and impose the solution. Impose it. But don't tell me it's a vital national strategic American interest... and then not do anything."" Finally there is Israel. In the same week that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen refused to rule out the possibility that the US will shoot down Israeli jets en route to attack Iran's nuclear installations, and Obama again blamed Israel for the deaths of US soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, Jim Jones tried to reassure Jewish Democrats that despite the administration's hostile actions and statements, it is not hostile to Israel. Jones's speech was part of a very public outreach plan the administration adopted last week in the face of a groundswell of American Jewish anger at Obama for his adversarial posture towards Israel. Given that American Jews have been the Democratic Party's most secure voting bloc since 1932, recent polls showing that the majority of American Jews oppose Obama's treatment of Israel are a political earthquake. According to a Quinnipiac poll published last week, a whopping 67 percent of American Jews disapprove of Obama's handling of the situation between Israel and the Palestinians. A poll of American Jews taken by John McLaughlin earlier this month showed that a plurality of American Jews would consider voting for a candidate other than Obama in the next presidential elections. And on Israel, American Jewish disapproval of Obama is fully consonant with the views of the general public. As the Quinnipiac poll shows, only 35 percent of Americans approve of his treatment of Israel. Jones's speech before the Washington Institute for Middle East Policy was a friendly affair. He waxed on dreamily about how wonderful the US's alliance with Israel is and how much Obama values Israel. And the crowd rewarded him with a standing ovation. But the substance of his speech made absolutely clear that while Obama and his advisors are concerned that for the first time in 80 years a significant number of American Jews may abandon the Democratic Party, they are unwilling to pay even the slightest substantive price to keep the Jews loyal to their party. After he finished his declarations of love and his joke about crafty Jewish businessmen in Afghanistan, Jones made clear that the Obama administration continues to view Israel's refusal to surrender more land to the Palestinians as the key reason its efforts to convince Iran to give up its nuclear program, the Syrians to quit the Iranian axis, the Palestinians and the Lebanese to quit the terror racket and the Iraqis and the Afghans to behave like Americans have all failed. As he put it, ""One of the ways that Iran exerts influence in the Middle East is by exploiting the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict. Iran uses the conflict to keep others in the region on the defensive and to try to limit its own isolation. Ending this conflict, achieving peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and establishing a sovereign Palestinian state would therefore take such an evocative issue away from Iran, Hizbullah, and Hamas."" JONES, OBAMA and the rest of their gang must have been asleep when the Saudis, Egyptians, Jordanians and the rest of the Arabs told them that Iran is unrelated to the Palestinian issue and that it must be stopped from acquiring nuclear weapons regardless of the status of Israeli-Palestinian relations. This after all has been the main message communicated to Obama and his advisers since January 2009 by every Sunni-majority state in the region as well as by many Iraqi Shiites. They must have been at the golf course when their generals in Iraq and Afghanistan warned them about Iran providing weapons and training to irregular forces killing US servicemen. The fact that even as he faced a Jewish audience, Jones couldn't resist the temptation to repeat the central fallacy at the root of the administration's failed policies in the Middle East makes clear that the Obama administration fundamentally does not care that the American people as a whole and the American Jewish community specifically oppose its policies. It will continue to push its policies in the face of that opposition no matter what. And if American Jews want to leave the party, well, they shouldn't slam the door on their way out. The Obama administration's treatment of New York Senator Charles Schumer this week is case in point. Schumer has been one of Obama's most loyal supporters. If as expected Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid loses his reelection bid in November, Schumer is in line to replace him as the Democratic leader in the Senate. Yet this week, responding to what has likely been an enormous outcry from his constituents, Schumer blasted Obama for his shabby and dangerous treatment of Israel. Rather than respond graciously to Schumer's criticism, Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs dismissed it sneeringly saying, ""I don't think that it's a stretch to say we don't agree with what Senator Schumer said in those remarks."" In his interview last week with Channel 2, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said he has no doubt that if Obama wishes to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons he is capable of doing so. As he put it, ""Barack Obama demonstrated his determination with regard to issues he felt were important, and his determination was quite impressive. I think President Obama can show that same determination with regard to Iran."" No doubt Netanyahu is correct. Moreover, the politics of such a move would make sense for him. Whereas Obama's decision to ram the nationalization of the US healthcare industry through Congress against the wishes of the American public caused his personal ratings and those of his party to plummet, were Obama to decide to take on Iran, he would win the overwhelming support of the American public. Indeed, a determined and successful bid by Obama to block Iran's nuclear aspirations could potentially block what is currently looking like a midterm election catastrophe for his party in November. But as Gates's memo about Iran, Clinton's announcement that the administration will go ahead with its plan to dispatch an ambassador to Damascus, Mitchell's latest failure with the Palestinians, Jones's newest accusation against Israel, and the US's strategic incoherence in Iraq and Afghanistan all show, mere politics are irrelevant to Obama. It doesn't bother him that his most loyal supporters abandoning him. It doesn't matter that his policies have endangered the Middle East and the world as a whole. Obama's refusal to acknowledge his own failures make clear that his goal is different than that of his predecessors. He is here to transform America's place in the world, not to safeguard the world. And he will move ahead with his transformative change even if it means abetting war. He will push on with his transformative change even if it means that Iran becomes a nuclear power. And he will push on even if it means that US forces are forced to leave Afghanistan and Iraq in defeat. Êcaroline@carolineglick.com"
45,BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-02-06,"Israel's Lieberman doesn't regret Syria remarks, denies US asked clarifications",,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"February 6, 2010",,"Excerpt from report by state funded, editorially independent Israel TV on 5 February [""Exclusive"" interview with Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman by political correspondent Ayala Hason - live] [Hason] Do you regret saying that not only will Syria lose the next war, but that Al-Asad and his family will lose their rule? [Lieberman] God forbid. I would like to point out that I am surprised each time anew: Every threat against us, however blunt it may be, is accepted here as self-evident, whereas any response on our part is seen as upsetting the gentile master - we mustn't upset the master, we mustn't respond, what do we think we are we doing. I have yet to see this approach, this policy of obsequiousness and self-abasement bringing us a single achievement. [Hason] How exactly can the Al-Asad family be toppled? Is there a detailed plan? [Lieberman] First of all, it should be clear that we are not looking for a confrontation or friction with the Syrians, and that we were not the ones who initiated the latest exchange of blows. However, when the Syrian foreign minister declares that Syria is going to attack populated centres in the State of Israel, and that if we only dare lay a finger on Hezbollah it will also attack us - that's crossing every possible red line we knew before. [Hason] You didn't answer my question. What did you mean when you said that Al-Asad must take into account that he will not remain in power forever? Is there some kind of plan behind your statement? [Lieberman] I believe the message was conveyed accurately and that there is no need to elaborate. What was relayed is enough, and I hope the message was understood. I repeat: We are not interested either in a deterioration of the situation or in a confrontation, and we don't plan to initiate any move. However, as I said before, neither will we make any concessions. I'm also surprised by the commentaries in the media, and about the mercenary journalists who provide commentaries and interpretations. Yisra'el Beytenu launched its election campaign in Qatzrin in the Golan Heights. Our political platform includes a chapter on foreign policy. We stand behind everything we promised to our voters. I'm sorry that I never turn the other cheek or say that things are different once you are in government. [Hason] As you mentioned, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'allim made a very aggressive statement. In fact, in response to Defence Minister Ehud Baraq's call for peace, he said Syria would attack Israel's cities. The question is whether your message, given its tone and wording, was the proper for a foreign minister. [Lieberman] It wasn't only Walid al-Mu'allim. The next evening Al-Asad himself delivered the same message, perhaps slightly differently worded. I repeat, this constituted a crossing of a red line, which we had never witnessed before. It was a direct threat to attack populated centres and cities in central Israel. I think my words came at the right time, immediately, and in the right dosage. [Hason] In other words, you don't regret what you said, neither the substance nor the style. [Lieberman] Neither the substance nor the style. On the contrary, look what the policy of obsequiousness brought us. We returned to the Blue Line in Lebanon, and what did we get in return? Hezbollah and the Second Lebanon War! We withdrew from the Qatif Bloc, and what did we get in return? Hamas, Operation Cast Lead, and rockets! [Hason] What do you think you achieved with your declarations? Is the Arab world afraid of you? Does it take you seriously? [Lieberman] I don't need anybody to fear me or the State of Israel. From the day this government was established, we said that we were ready to enter direct negotiations without preconditions. [Hason] With Syria? [Lieberman] Both with Syria and with the Palestinians, but nothing has changed. [Hason] You are declaring here this evening that you are prepared to enter negotiations, but not to withdraw from the Golan. [Lieberman] I said I'm not ready to accept any a priori dictate about the outcome of the negotiations. My position is clear. [Hason] Not to forgo the Golan. [Lieberman] The Golan Heights must be part of the State of Israel. [Hason] Does the prime minister think likewise? [Lieberman] I'm not inside the prime minister's head. [Hason] But you are the foreign minister, and you know what his views are. [Lieberman] I present my views accurately, as I always have. I believe that just like it learned to forgo the dream of Greater Syria, recognized Lebanon, and opened an embassy there; just like it conceded the Iskenderun province - a far vaster and more significant territory than the Golan Heights - to the Turks and recognized Turkish sovereignty over it, there is no reason why Syria shouldn't do the same in our case. [Hason] You delivered your speech at Bar-Ilan University yesterday morning, the radio broadcast it, and an uproar ensued in Israel and in the world. Then in the afternoon the prime minister phones you, and what does he tell you? [Lieberman] You don't expect me to quote my conversation with the prime minister. [Hason] Does he reprimand you? Does he tell you: Yvet, why did you say that? [Lieberman] God forbid. I think we had a very businesslike conversation and we issued a joint communique that expressed exactly.... [Hason, interrupting] Is Netanyahu afraid of criticizing you because you are unpredictable and you might call it quits? [Lieberman] Netanyahu and I have known each other more than one day, and our relationship knows no fear or reluctance to tell each other things in the most candid manner. Again, the aforementioned mercenary journalist said today that the prime minister was afraid to say something to Avigdor Lieberman, and that he placed to phone call to me only after a senior Likud minister pressured him to do so. [Hason] Leaving aside all the interpretations, is Netanyahu afraid of you? [Lieberman] No. This should be stressed, because this journalist belongs with the commentators who wrote Ph.D. dissertations in 1977 explaining why Menahem Begin would never be elected Israel's prime minister. [Hason] Are those commentators wrong, too? Will you be elected Israel's prime minister? [Lieberman] I think that Netanyahu and Lieberman speak out their minds, openly, and every day. [Hason] Do Netanyahu and Lieberman see the situation eye to eye? [Lieberman] I think we mostly do see eye to eye. Of course, we belong to two different parties, with different emphases. However, for the most part... [Hason, interrupting] Some claim that you address your statements to your potential voters, that you tell them: I am a strong leader, who wants to be elected; I'm not afraid to say what's on my mind, and I don't speak like the foreign minister of the State of Israel. [Lieberman] I read yet another commentary today whereby Lieberman.... [Hason, interrupting] I see that you devoted a lot of time to today's commentaries in the press. [Lieberman] Look, my spokesman worked very hard. For half an hour, he told me all about it as we drove to Tel Aviv. [Hason] I thought he worked hard at repelling the criticism of you granting us an exclusive interview. [Lieberman] On that he worked far harder. One commentator wrote that Lieberman had actually sought to torpedo a move to launch a secret dialogue with Syria. Well, let me tell you that there is no secret move, there is no secret dialogue. Were there to be a dialogue, it would be out in the open and not secret. The same applies to the claim that Lieberman is sending a message to his voters. My voters in Israel know exactly what I represent. As I said, I speak clearly. We said our piece before the elections, and we stated our positions in our political platform. I don't change, I don't zigzag, I don't need to explain day in and day out why I change my views. All those who voted for us knew exactly what they were voting for. [Hason] But you are part of a coalition and you cannot keep your worldview intact; you have to compromise. [Lieberman] That's right, which is why I follow the basic guidelines. [Hason] Incidentally, did the United States ask for clarifications from Israel? [Lieberman] None whatsoever. [Hason] You know nothing about it. Could it be that they asked for clarifications from somebody and you didn't hear about it? [Lieberman] We spoke with several senior officials in the US Administration today, including in the State Department, and we heard nothing of the sort.

46,BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-08-10,"Senior aide to Iran leader discussed Lebanon, Syria on TV",,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"August 11, 2010",,"At 1815 gmt, state-run Iranian TV channel two started a live debate with a senior aide on international affairs to the Supreme Leader (Ali Khamene'i) Dr Ali-Akbar Velayati. Velayati is a foreign policy advisor to the leader and had made a trip to Lebanon and Syria last week in this capacity. The programme started by a report from the Middle-East in which the Lebanese Hezbollah Leader Seyyed Hasan Nasrallah had alleged that Israel is complicit in the murder of late Lebanese Leader Rafiq Hariri; he named two alleged collaborators. He alleged that Hezbollah was wrongly accused by Israel to undermine its position. At 1823 gmt, the studio turned to Velayati to ask about the significance of his trip at this juncture. Velayati said that he was representing the Islamic televisions and radio organisation to participate in a conference in Lebanon. Stressing the influence of this group, he added that this organisation is significant as an organisation to enhance the self-confidence of Islamic nations. Explaining the role of the media in the soft war he underlined the attempts of the West to sow doubt in the minds of the Islamic youth in relation to their religion. He spoke at length about Islamic civilisation where the debate then focused on the reception he received from the officials in Lebanon. On the officials held with Nasrallah and others, Velayati said that entering the airport he was warmly received by the Lebanese officials. He was asked by the media on a tribunal at The Hague against Hezbollah. He added that the ""Zionists"" have influenced The Hague. He went on to say that previous to this, Syria was targeted in order to eject it from the Lebanon in the course of the Ta'if Accord. Once the Syrians were ejected, he went on, the West rounded on Hezbollah to use the Hariri issue to undermine this Shi'i political organisation. He accused that the Rafiq Hariri inquiry group convened by The Hague has politicised the matter and is in the hands of the Americans and Israelis. On his meeting with Nasrallah, Velayati said that he had a lengthy discussion with the Hezbollah leader. He added that this shows the significance of the Hezbollah for the Islamic Republic. He added that the meeting was symbolic as it means that the Islamic Republic is serious about its support for the Hezbollah. He went on to say that Nasrallah had no intention of compromising over the Hariri issue. He warned against alleged Western attempts to sow discord between the Shi'i and the Sunni sects in Lebanon using the Hariri case. He added that this is a ploy to allow America and the Israelis to regain a foothold inside Lebanon. On the four-way meeting with Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria and others, he said that Iran would support any diplomatic initiatives to settle disputes. He added that Syria would not stand idly seeing the weakening of Hezbollah. He assessed the outcome of this meeting as positive. On allegations that the absence of Iran is tantamount to a failure for Iran, he said that this was a Saudi initiative and Iran does not need anyone's permission in its supportive role for Hezbollah. He stressed that Iran's role is appreciated and well-understood inside Lebanon whether Iran participates in these meetings or not. On Nasrallah's morale presently, Velayati remarked that Nasrallah is an exceptional individual who is a public servant and a very pious man. He delineated Nasrallah's dedication adding that with the passage of time, Nasrallah has become even stronger personally. On the ups and downs in Shi'i politics in Lebanon and the about-turn of Druze Leader Walid Jumblatt, Velayati said that the Islamic resistance is a source of pride for all the Muslim world. He recalled the fighting between Amal and Hezbollah or Amal and the Palestinians in the 1980's adding that Iran worked hard to create the present harmony between erstwhile political foes. On pro-Western groups inside Lebanon and their pressure on Hezbollah, Velayati said that the reason why there is so much hostility against Hezbollah is quite clear; the explosion of the myth of ""Zionist invincibility"". He added that the so-called pro-West block inside Middle East have gained nothing from either the USA or the Israeli government. He delineated late President Yasir Arafat's ""olive branch"" to the Israelis as well as Late Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat signing of the Camp David Accord as being cases in point. He added that the result of so much compromise with the West is the siege of the Gaza strip by Israel today. He then talked at length about Palestinian and Israeli history and the ups and down in Arab-Israeli conflict. He underlined the compromising policies of Palestinian Leader Mahmud Abbas. He added that despite this compromise the Israelis harass the Palestinians on the West Bank and Jerusalem on daily basis. He concluded, therefore, that Israel has to be resisted as either way the Israelis would not stop brutalising the Arabs be it in Jerusalem or the West Bank. On whether there is likely to be another Israeli military assault on any country in the Middle East, he said that it is not in their interests to embark on another major military adventure. He said that rationally speaking Hezbollah is stronger since 2006 when the 33-Day War happened. Israel, he went on, is proportionately weaker since then. This would mean that another military adventure would result in a heavier defeat than the 33-Day War. He added that he has seen the extensive network of tunnels inside mountains by the Hezbollah and it is impressive indeed. On Syria's alleged distancing itself from the Hezbollah of Lebanon, Velayati said that President Bashar al-Asad is a worthy successor to his enlightened father (Hafez al-Asad). He added that given that Syria has secured its foothold and the fact that the demands of Syria and Lebanon have been incorporated in the Saudi-brokered four way accord is a victory for Syria. He went on to say that despite the fact that Saudi Arabia was a supporter of the pro-West 14 March Group and is now entering talks with Syria is a sign of the extent of Syrian and Hezbollah's significance. On other issues being discussed with Bashar al-Asad, this senior aide to the supreme leader said that other issues were discussed, alluding to them in general terms. On his prediction of the outcome of the Hariri murder inquiry, Velayati pointed to the initiative that Nasrallah has adopted in naming the two alleged collaborators, adding: ""I doubt that the issue of Hariri's murder and accusations levelled against Hezbollah will hold much water now"". He also predicted that America's future in face of the ever-growing might of the resistance in the Middle East will not improve. The programme came to an end at 1908 gmt.

In those meetings the two sides stressed the need for keeping up the resistant movement in confrontation with the never-ending expansionist policies of the racist-Zionist regime. Velayati on Monday noon at a press conference at the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Damascus pointed out that Tehran cannot trust the United States due to the contradictory policies of that country, emphasizing, ""Iran would never abandon its fundamental values due to the US pressures."" He meanwhile announced Tehran's support for the establishment of the Iraqi Government, based on the viewpoints of the Iraqi people, political groups and parties, and the Constitution of Iraq, free from the aliens' pressure and influence. The consultant of the Supreme Leader during his visit of Syria meanwhile paid homage to the holy shrines of Lady Zeinab (P), Lady Roqayyeh (P), and Bab as-Saqir. Before his visit of Damascus, Velayati had met and conferred with high ranking Lebanese officials at Lebanese capital city, Beirut. He had arrived in Lebanon on an invitation made by the newly established Beirut-based Union of the Islamic World Radio Television Networks whose opening ceremony was held on Thursday evening. Velayati meanwhile met and conferred with the Secretary General of Hezbollah Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah, the Lebanese President Michel Suleiman, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, and the bereaved family members of the late Allameh Mohammad Hussain Fazlallah. In his meeting with Fazlallah family Velayati praised that late leader's role in preservation of the Islamic unity, in confrontation with the plots hatched by the Zionists and for his strong support for the oppressed Palestinian nation.

Beirut MP Ammar Houri, a member of Prime Minister Saad Hariri's Future parliamentary bloc, also struck an upbeat note about the outcome of the Riyadh-Damascus cooperation to resolve the crisis over the indictment, saying the two countries' efforts are expected to achieve ""fruitful results."" Amid hopes of a breakthrough in the Saudi-Syrian bid, Britain warned that the Lebanese deadlock over the indictment, which is widely expected to implicate some Hizbullah members, might erupt into violence. British Foreign Secretary William Hague told Sky News Sunday that Lebanon ""is one of our concerns over the coming weeks."" ""We think it's very important that [the] tribunal does its work,"" he said, referring to the UN-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL), which will prosecute suspects in Hariri's assassination. Lebanon and Sudan are the ""two areas in January that are most obvious at this stage to watch for a political crisis or an outbreak of violence,"" Hague said, referring also to the January 9 referendum on South Sudan independence. ""So across the international community we must be ready to do everything we can to assist with those countries,"" he said. Hague's remarks conform with reports that the indictment, that was widely expected to be released this month, has now been postponed until next month. Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said in an interview Friday that the postponement of the indictment is linked to a new approach in US policy aimed to defuse political tensions with Iran and other tension spots, including Lebanon. The STL's registrar Herman von Hebel told journalists at the court's headquarters in the Netherlands December 9 that the office of the tribunal's prosecutor Daniel Bellemare will send a draft indictment to the pre-trial judge for confirmation ""very, very soon."" The report about the looming indictment has heightened political tension in the country and led to a Cabinet paralysis and a split between the March 8 and March 14 factions over the indictment and the controversial issue of ""false witnesses"" before the STL. The Cabinet failed to settle this issue during its latest meeting Wednesday, prompting President Michel Sleiman to defer the discussions when the ministers of the March 8 alliance demanded a vote on the issue that has crippled the government's work since November 10. Hizbullah and its allies in the March 8 alliance have demanded that Cabinet acts on this issue, either by consensus or by a vote by referring it to the Judicial Council, the country's highest court. This demand was rejected by March 14 factions which fear that investigating ""false witnesses"" by the Judicial Council would eventually obstruct the STL's work. Houri said in remarks published Sunday that the Saudi-Syria mediation bid is making progress. In an interview with Al-Mustaqbal newspaper, Houri also said that efforts are under way to convene the Cabinet before the Christmas and New Year holidays. Asked to comment on the results of the Saudi-Syrian bid, Houri said, ""This bid is going on and is heading in the right direction. It has made progress and is heading in a way to achieve fruitful results that will reflect positively on stability in Lebanon and on relations among internal political parties."" He said that Hariri told a meeting of the Future bloc last Friday that he will consult with Sleiman on the possibility of convening the Cabinet before the holidays to discuss urgent issues, including people's living conditions. Speaker Berri, part of the March 8 camp, accused the March 14 factions of crippling the government's work by refusing to vote on referring the issue of ""false witnesses"" to the Judicial Council. In an interview with the Iranian news agency IRNA, Berri said that it was agreed to devote last Wednesday's Cabinet session to discussing the issue of ""false witnesses"" either by consensus or by a vote. ""When consensus could not be reached, the president wanted to avoid this matter by discussing other items [on the agenda]. The Constitution provides for contentious issues to be put to a vote ... When the opposition [March 8] ministers proposed putting the issue to a vote, this proposal was rejected and they are still rejecting it,"" Berri said. Berri added that the current crisis over the indictment is ""a blackmail operation by some big powers abroad and is also being exploited in the interior to serve interests and purposes of which we are aware."" Meanwhile, Hizbullah, which has warned that time was running out for the Saudi- Syrian bid to break the deadlock over the indictment, is giving rival factions more time to reach an agreement to protect Lebanon against the threat of strife. ""We want an understanding that protects the country from the evil of strife to which the Israelis are trying to drag some [Lebanese factions]. Therefore, we are extending time again and again in order to see an understanding is born before the [Israeli] enemy, through its tools in the international tribunal and its procedures, acts to fabricate an indictment [based on] forgery, misleading, lies and hollow allegations,"" MP Mohammed Raad, head of Hizbullah's parliamentary bloc, told an Ashura event procession in the southern market town of Nabatiyeh. Raad said the indictment was aimed at undermining Lebanon's national peace and stability. Rather than serving Lebanon's unity, independence and sovereignty, this indictment serves ""the interest of the Israeli enemy and the American project in Lebanon and the region,"" he said. Raad added that Hizbullah, which has dismissed the STL as an ""American-Israeli"" tool to incite strife, is extending its hands to the March 14 factions to save the country. ""Hizbullah's aim is to save this country from an international conspiracy that seeks to enslave and humiliate the Lebanese, control their resources and tamper with their future,"" he said. ""Our hands are extended to anyone who shares these aims with us."" Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Nasrallah Butros Sfeir said he hoped that next year would be ""a good year of prosperity for all the Lebanese."" ""We implore God that the next year will be better than past years and that all obstacles will be eliminated so that people can live in peace and calm,"" Sfeir told visitors in a statement carried by the state-run National News Agency (NNA). Former Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said the Lebanese were capable of warding off the threat of strife. ""The Lebanese are keen on preventing strife,"" Siniora said, as reported by the NNA. ""Any act that leads to the use of offensive words or remarks that lead to sectarian tensions is rejected."" In tandem with the Saudi-Syrian efforts, Siniora, also the leader of the parliamentary Future bloc, said that rival Lebanese factions should sit together and talk to each other in order to solve the crisis over the indictment. ""The Arab efforts, exerted by brotherly Syria, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Egypt or Qatar or by the Arab League, are appreciated and supported, but they will not replace the Lebanese efforts which are the essential efforts,"" he said. Siniora indirectly blamed March 8 factions for crippling the work of the government and other state institutions, saying that the Cabinet must not be taken ""hostage."" 50 of 266 DOCUMENTS The Daily Telegraph (London) January 1, 2011 Saturday Edition 1; National Edition Senate fury as Obama renews ties with Syria PRESIDENT Barack Obama has appointed the first American ambassador to Syria since 2005, infuriating Republicans who were blocking the move in the Senate. They claimed that the appointment of Robert Ford, a career diplomat, would inappropriately reward Damascus while it still had strong ties to Hizbollah, the Lebanon-based paramilitary group condemned by the United States as a terrorist organisation. Mr Obama used the opportunity of a Congress in recess to appoint Mr Ford, meaning that he does not need to be confirmed by the Senate but can serve only until December, 2011. The Bush administration withdrew its ambassador from Syria in February, 2005, in protest at the assassination of Rafiq al-Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister, in a Beirut bomb attack that killed 22 others. Syrian intelligence officials are suspected of being behind the attack, something President Bashar al-Assad of Syria has strenuously denied. Mr Ford, nominated in February, was among six nominees long stalled in the Senate that Mr Obama decided to appoint this week. The most controversial was James Cole as deputy attorney general. Republicans had expressed concerns about comments he had made about terrorism and his work as an independent contractor for AIG, the insurance company. Mr Obama has made re-engagement with Syria part of its efforts to make bro-ker a peace deal between Israel and its Arab neighbours. The appointment indicates a significant change in his Middle East strategy. Indirect peace talks between Israel and Syria, mediated by Turkey, ceased in December, 2008, when Israel began a three-week military offensive in the Gaza Strip against Islamic groups firing rockets into southern Israel. Mr Obama also appointed Francis Ricciardone as the new ambassador to Turkey, a post vacant since July. His nomination had been held up in the Senate for several months over concerns that Turkey was growing increasingly hostile to Israel and closer to Iran. The appointment of Mr Ford is unlikely to produce a marked change in US-Syrian relations and there is no obvious quid pro quo from Damascus. His first priority is likely to be Lebanon, where a United Nations-supported international tribunal is expected to indict members of Hizbollah in the Hariri case. Hizbollah and its allies, including highranking Syrian officials, have warned that any indictment could provoke civil con-flict. They have unsuccessfully pressed Mr Hariri's son Saad, now Lebanon's prime minister, to distance himself from the tribunal. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the new Republican chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, said that Mr Ford's appointment was a ""major concession to the Syrian regime"" without a price being exacted in return. ""That is the wrong message to be sending to a regime which continues to harm and threaten US interests and those of such critical allies as Israel,"" she said."

The two sides stressed the necessity for continuation and development of dialogue on the parliamentarian and governmental levels with the aim of reaching satisfactory bilateral relations, particularly in political and economic domains, underlining the importance of exchanging visits on all levels between the two countries. President al-Assad underlined that the current Israeli government which has repeatedly announced through its foreign minister its anti-peace stand, complicating all endeavours for realizing it. He underlined that the most important thing is to layout a clear plan that forms the ground for a peace built on resolutions of international legitimacy which was exactly what Syria worked on through the indirect negotiations with the mediation of Turkey. Regarding Iraq, stress was made that Iraq should remain unified and therefore any current political process should include all spectrums of the Iraqi people. Talks also dealt with the Association Agreement between Syria and the European Union where the Czech delegation expressed readiness to support the Syrian demands in this framework at the establishments of the EU. The meeting was attended by Chairman of the People's Assembly's Foreign Relations Committee, Suleiman Haddad and the Czech ambassador to Syria. In this framework, Speaker of the People's Assembly, Mahmoud al-Abrash discussed with Dienstbier and an accompanying delegation ways of boosting parliamentary relations and utilization of the parliamentary expertise and experiences in both countries. The Czech delegation discussed with the Arab and Foreign Relations Committee at the Peoples' Assembly future prospects of boosting bilateral parliamentary relations. In a statement to reporters, Dienstbier described his meeting with President al-Assad as excellent during which numerous suggestions for boosting bilateral relations were made. He added that he had noticed a remarkable development in Syrian-Czech relations in various fields particularly in the economic sphere, stressing the deep and historical relations between the two countries and his country's keenness to push them up to the highest levels. Dienstbier stressed his country's full support to Syria's right to restore the occupied Syrian Golan, and readiness to contribute to the activation of the peace process in the region, describing Israel's decision to build new settlements as impeding the realization of security and peace in the region.

53,The International Herald Tribune,2010-04-03,"In visit, U.S. senator acts to foster ties with Syria",,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,NEWS; Pg. 4,"April 2, 2010",321 words,"The meeting between Senator John F. Kerry and President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus is another sign that the United States is moving to re-engage with Syria as the Obama administration works to resuscitate Middle East peace talks. Mr. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, visited Damascus on Thursday as the U.S. Senate takes up the appointment of Robert Ford as ambassador to Syria. The United States has not had an ambassador in Damascus since 2005, shortly after the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri in Beirut. Syria was blamed for the killing, an accusation that it has denied. After his meeting with Mr. Assad, Mr. Kerry said in a statement that the United States and Syria shared ''a mutual interest in having a very frank exchange on any differences that may exist, but also on the many, many agreements that we have about the possibilities of peace in this region.'' The United States and its Arab allies are hopeful that re-engagement with Syria may encourage its leaders to distance themselves from Iran, an economic and strategic alliance that Syria has fostered for decades. Mr. Kerry has also expressed concern over Syria's role in providing arms to Hezbollah, a Lebanese militia and a political and social organization deemed a terrorist group by the United States. In 2003, Mr. Kerry co-sponsored the Syrian Accountability Act, which imposed sanctions on Damascus. But he has since pushed for renewed dialogue. In a statement last month at the nomination hearing for Mr. Ford, Mr. Kerry said, ''The real challenge is not deciding whether to engage - it will be in finding a viable path to improved relations.'' Because Syria is faced with a looming economic crisis as its oil wells run dry, and because it has a growing population of young people who need jobs and housing, Syria has an incentive to re-engage with the West, he said."
54,The Globe and Mail (Canada),2010-10-13,"To a tense Lebanon, add Ahmadinejad; As Iranian leader pays a visit, Iran-backed Hezbollah making increasingly threatening noises against Saudi-supported PM Saad Hariri",,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,A-SECTION; Pg. A15,"April 29, 2010",786 words,"pmartin@globeandmail.com Israelis can be forgiven if they wish Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ill on his two-day visit to Lebanon this week. The outspoken Mr. Ahmadinejad is Israel's worst nightmare and his plan to visit the predominantly Shia south of Lebanon on Thursday, peering over what used to be known as the ""good fence"" between Israel and Lebanon, sends shivers down Israeli spines. Already, south Lebanese towns that were overrun by Israeli forces in the summer of 2006 are displaying huge billboards welcoming the Iranian President, who is scheduled to open a lavish garden that includes a giant replica of Jerusalem's golden Dome of the Rock. Wednesday evening, Mr. Ahmadinejad will be feted at a massive outdoor rally staged by a grateful Hezbollah, the militant Shia political organization funded in large part by Iran. Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah says his militia now possesses some 40,000 missiles capable of striking Israel; most, if not all, of them coming from Iran. With Mr. Ahmadinejad's popularity reportedly plummeting in Iran - even among his erstwhile supporters in the Revolutionary Guard - Lebanon is the one place where the man is sure to be embraced. Hezbollah is, after all, ""perhaps the only significant foreign policy success of the Islamic revolution in Iran,"" says Rami Khouri, the former editor of Beirut's Daily Star newspaper. With Iran's help, Hezbollah has become a major force in Lebanese politics and a significant player in the Arab-Israeli conflict. But if the Iranian visit is good for Mr. Ahmadinejad and for Hezbollah, it's not so good for Lebanon as a whole. A surging Hezbollah is making increasingly threatening noises against the government of Saad Hariri. Two years ago, Hezbollah fighters took over the streets of several neighbourhoods in West Beirut in a two-week show of force. The group's goal was to maintain some of its privileges of power and to increase its role in the government. It succeeded on all fronts. Today, the goal is to discredit, if not disband, the United Nations Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) investigating the 2005 assassination of Mr. Hariri's father, the former prime minister Rafik Hariri, and 22 others. The inquiry, headed by 58-year-old Canadian Daniel Bellemare, a former chief prosecutor for Canada's Justice Department, is expected to hand down its first indictments before the end of the year, and Hezbollah names are rumoured to be at the top of the list. The tribunal initially named Syrian officials as suspects and detained four pro- Syrian Lebanese generals for four years, before releasing them last year for want of evidence. While Syria still is viewed as the culprit by many Lebanese, Prime Minister Hariri has publicly assured Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that he accepts this is not the case. Hezbollah is determined not to take the blame for the February, 2005, roadside bombing, and accuses the STL of basing its indictments on ""false witnesses"" and questionable ""Israeli intelligence."" It is using its presence in parliament to hold up Lebanon's budget until the annual $50-million funding of the STL is dropped, and it demands that the matter of ""false witnesses"" be taken up by the Justice Ministry before the STL proceeds further. So far, Mr. Hariri remains firm in his support of the inquiry, a UN mission his government requested in 2005. Considering that Mr. Hariri is strongly backed by Saudi Arabia, and Hezbollah by Iran, the two parties appear headed for a serious showdown. Hezbollah ""will start with rhetoric and political pressure, like we have now,"" says Paul Salem, director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Beirut, ""and escalation might then include civil disobedience, demonstrations, closing of roads, of the airport."" So tense has the atmosphere become that Mr. Nasrallah felt compelled on the weekend to disavow rumours he was planning a coup d'etat. ""If we wanted to do so, we would have done that in 2005, but we don't want that,"" the Hezbollah leader said. From his vantage on a mountaintop 80 kilometres to the east, Syrian President al-Assad is looking on with not a little trepidation. While Syria is perceived as an ally of Iran - Mr. al-Assad made a high-profile visit to Tehran earlier this month - the Syrian leader is not comfortable with Iran staking a primary claim to influence in Lebanon. That's a role Mr. al-Assad covets for himself. As such, he can be expected to try to play Hezbollah off against Mr. Hariri, then offer Syrian assistance in resolving the political crisis. 55 of 266 DOCUMENTS The Washington Post April 29, 2010 Thursday Suburban Edition The Cable foreign policy's Josh rogin; Highlights from http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com Study: Guidance needed to apply sanctions U.S. officials in Damascus lack clear guidance on how to implement U.S. economic sanctions against the Syrian regime, an internal State Department study has found. ""The most immediate issue requiring greater clarity concerns economic sanctions,"" reads the department's inspector general's latest report on the U.S. Embassy in Syria. ""There is no front-channel guidance on the issue. The inspection team reviewed email and informal traffic regarding sanctions and waiver policy, and found several areas in which the guidance appeared to be contradictory."" The major U.S. sanctions against Syria are laid out in the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, which limits U.S. exports there to food, water and a select list of items approved by the Commerce Department. While the embassy staff in Damascus, without an ambassador since 2005, are diligent in documenting the Syrian government's efforts to subvert the sanctions, the report found there was ""inadequate guidance regarding how embassy officers should advise potential U.S. exporters of sanctions and possible waivers."" The investigators also found that the Syrian government's engagement remains poor, almost one year after the Obama administration announced its intention to restore an ambassador to Syria. The embassy has noticed some increased access to Syrian officials, but they mostly avoid contact with U.S. diplomats. For example, the charge d'affaires, Charles F. ""Chuck"" Hunter, is not able to meet with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem. ""Most Embassy business, routine and otherwise, is conducted through diplomatic note or during visits by senior Washington officials and congressional delegations, when access is granted,"" the report states. Nominee faces GOP grilling over love affair President Obama's nomination of Mari Carmen Aponte to be the next U.S. ambassador to El Salvador still faces Republican opposition because of a relationship she had with a Cuban American more than 15 years ago. Objections surfaced during Tuesday's business meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which approved the nomination of the Washington attorney despite ""no"" votes by several GOP committee members. Led by Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), the Republicans are demanding more information about Aponte's long-ago romance with Roberto Tamayo, a Cuban-born insurance salesman who was alleged to have ties to both the FBI and Fidel Castro's intelligence apparatus. Republicans want access to all FBI's records on the relationship. The FBI interviewed both Aponte and Tamayo about the matter back in 1993, but Aponte declined to take a lie-detector test. Citing ""personal reasons,"" she withdrew from consideration to be ambassador to the Dominican Republic in 1998 after then-Sen. Jesse Helms promised to ask invasive questions about the relationship at her hearing. ""The allegations were apparently serious enough for her to withdraw her nomination in 1998, so I think it's fair to ask some questions,"" DeMint told The Cable. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), defended Aponte after seeing at least some of the FBI's material. ""If I thought that after having reviewed the file that Miss Aponte would be a security risk to the United States in any context, but particularly in the context of the Castro regime having access to her, I would oppose her. But that is simply not the case,"" he said. At her March 17 confirmation hearing, Aponte gave her most detailed account to date about the relationship and her interactions with Cuban officials in the 1980s. ""It was a romantic relationship,"" she said, which included ""social contacts"" with other couples in the Cuba interests section. Senator says Obama improving toward Israel The Obama White House has improved its approach to both Israel and the American Jewish community in the last week, according to Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), who has emerged as a tough critic of Obama's handling of the Israeli government. Schumer made news last week when he said on the Nachum Segal Show that Obama's approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was ""counterproductive."" He also said there was a battle going on about the policy inside the Obama administration and that if his side didn't win, ""we'll have to take it to the next step."" Backing off those comments Tuesday, Schumer said that he sees changes in the White House's approach to dealing with pro-Israel groups in the United States and can envision the ""possibility"" of changes in the administration's policies toward Israel and the Palestinian Authority. ""People in the pro-Israel community are feeling a sense that they're being listened to and there might be some changes,"" Schumer said."

Despite an earlier call from US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pressing Syria to tone down its relations with Iran, leaders from both these countries proudly reaffirmed their warm ties. Editorial The show of unity between the Iranian and Syrian presidents during a meeting in Damascus Thursday puzzled some Western observers who thought that Syria's recent rapprochement with the US would have transformed the country into a servile ally. Despite an earlier call from US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pressing Syria to tone down its relations with Iran, leaders from both these countries proudly reaffirmed their warm ties. Baffled observers should know better. The reasons that lie behind Washington's incapacity to reach out to Damascus and the rest of the broader Middle East region are as quite simple and are founded on America's dazzling incapacity to formulate a sensible policy for the region. The United States' achievements make the country's power of attraction unequalled today, and should make it a luminary among nations. But despite the numerous think tanks and top-rate universities, the US seems incapable of harnessing the knowledge it produces and channeling it into shaping a coherent policy for the Middle East. How has so much research and effort not led to the discovery that anti-Americanism in the Middle East stems first and foremost from the country's incapacity to genuinely commit to being an even-handed broker the Middle-East peace effort? How can US policy-makers not know that until they formulate a policy that is as firm on the Israelis as it is on the Palestinians, their attempts to curb other problems in the region - such as Iran's and Syria's defiant foreign policies - will only be in vain? Surely the country's intelligentsia should have acknowledged by now that Iran is able to fulfill its strategic ambitions in the Middle East largely through discontent around the region for American policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation. If it appears that the American political class remains blind to this simple calculation, it is perhaps because of the powerful influence of the so-called 'Israel lobby,' which, having allied with large segments of the Republican and Democratic parties alike, is pushing rash military solutions to deal with Iran's potential nuclear ambitions. Before taking such foolish and self-destructive decisions, US policymakers would do well to recalibrate their approach on the basis of these simple facts: the region's leaders, and most importantly their people, will resentfully turn their back on US policy for as long as it only shows half-hearted commitments to security and human rights in the region. That is, blind support for Israeli aggression will only push regional powers together, and as long as Iran and Syria share a common threat, the US can forget about driving them apart. 57 of 266 DOCUMENTS The Daily Star (Lebanon) December 31, 2010 Friday Syria welcomes appointment of US ambassador after Obama bypasses Senate's approval Obama took the rare step late Wednesday of forcing through the appointments of Ambassador Robert Ford and five other officials while the Senate - which normally needs to confirm nominations - was out of session. ""This step should have been taken a long time ago,"" Ali said, according to a statement carried by Lebanon's state-run news agency. ""We hope it will be within the context of correcting the US policy toward the entire region and reviewing its relations with the region away from bias."" A senior administration official traveling with Obama on vacation in Hawaii justified the recess appointments, which came despite talk of cooperation with Republicans in the waning days of the last Congress. ""All administrations face delays in getting some of their nominees confirmed, but the extent of Republican obstruction of Obama nominees is unprecedented,"" the official said on condition of anonymity. The US withdrew its ambassador to Damascus after Lebanon's former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's assassination in February 2005 was blamed on Syria. Obama announced his desire to put a new ambassador in Syria in 2009 and named Ford in February this year, advancing his policy of reaching out even to adversaries of the United States. The administration sees Syria as a crucial link in diplomatic efforts to negotiate peace in the Middle East and has hoped to step up intelligence cooperation with Syria. But Ford's nomination appears to have foundered amid concerns that Damascus may have sought to transfer Scud missiles to Hizbullah. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican who will head the House Foreign Affairs Committee next month after her party swept mid-term elections, accused Obama of offering concessions to a country that is ""destabilizing"" Lebanon where it backs Hizbullah. ""Making undeserved concessions to Syria tells the regime in Damascus that it can continue to pursue its dangerous agenda and not face any consequences from the US,"" the Florida lawmaker said in a statement.

In a sign of growing cooperation with Turkey, Syrian forces began operations in Damascus and four other cities in a crackdown on members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the P.K.K., suspected of ''being members of a terrorist organization, forcefully collecting money, attempting to divide Syrian land in efforts to form a separate state and inciting ethnic and religious separation among Kurds,'' the report said. Turkish officials said they were waiting for more information on the detentions. ''As far as we heard, Syrian security officials started these operations about two weeks ago,'' said a senior Foreign Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''At this stage, we need further feedback from Syrian authorities to confirm whether these detentions were directly P.K.K. related.'' Cooperation between Syria and Turkey has improved as Turkey's relations with Israel have deteriorated since the end of May, when nine Turkish citizens were killed during an Israeli raid on an aid flotilla trying to reach Gaza. For more than 30 years, the government in Damascus has been accused of allowing P.K.K. rebels to stage attacks into Turkey from Syrian soil. Tensions began easing only after the Syrian authorities expelled the P.K.K. leader Abdullah Ocalan in 1998. The Syrian operation took place as military officials said that Turkey had killed 12 P.K.K. rebels in eastern Turkey. Two Turkish soldiers and three civilian guards were also killed in the clashes near Siirt, in southeastern Turkey. P.K.K. violence has been escalating in Turkey, a development that the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan claims is a reaction to new efforts to expand political and cultural rights for the 12 million Kurds in Turkey. The government's initiatives have fallen short of Kurdish demands, which include education in the Kurdish language, constitutional recognition of Kurdish identity and amnesty for P.K.K. rebels. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

62,The Washington Post,2010-12-31,GOP lawmakers blast recess moves,Suburban Edition,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,A-SECTION; Pg. A03,"December 31, 2010",668 words,"Republicans are denouncing President Obama's appointment of what they say are questionable nominees to key jobs while Congress is away for the holidays. Obama made appointments on Wednesday to the posts of deputy attorney general and ambassador to Syria, taking advantage of the congressional recess to push through nominees that Republicans had previously blocked. The most controversial among them were James M. Cole, who will be second-in-command behind Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., and the new ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford. The so-called recess appointments avoid the normal Senate confirmation process, allowing the appointees to serve without the Senate's approval until the end of the incoming Congress. On Thursday, the GOP began to fight back, issuing some strongly worded statements critical of Obama's action. Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.), the incoming chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said Cole's appointment sends the wrong message. ""The appointment indicates that the Obama administration continues to try to implement its dangerous policies of treating Islamic terrorism as a criminal matter,"" King said, citing the recent furor over plans to try accused terrorists in civilian courts. Republicans have criticized Cole for writing in 2002, as a private attorney, that the attorney general's role is to prosecute criminals rather than fight a war. They have also pointed to his work as an independent consultant to the American International Group, or AIG, before its collapse and subsequent bailout in 2008. ""The recess appointment of such a questionable individual who so clearly could not be confirmed by the Senate for a position of this importance is unacceptable,"" said Rep. Candice S. Miller (R-Mich.), who sits on the Homeland Security Committee with King. Ford's nomination also irked Republicans, many of whom would prefer that the United States not appoint an ambassador to Syria at all. President George W. Bush had pulled his ambassador from Damascus in 2005, after the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq al-Hariri. Syrian intelligence officials were suspected in the killing; Syria's president has denied any involvement by his country. The United States has not sent an ambassador since then. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), the incoming chairwoman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, said late Wednesday that Ford's appointment represents a ""major concession to the Syrian regime."" ""That is the wrong message to be sending to a regime which continues to harm and threaten U.S. interests and those of such critical allies as Israel,"" she said. In May, 12 Republican senators sent a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressing concerns about engaging with Syria and saying they wanted those concerns addressed before voting on a new ambassador. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has accused Syria of supplying arms to Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. Clinton has said that sending an emissary to Damascus does not constitute a reward. One of those who signed the letter, Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, said after the appointments that he thinks they're the wrong path. ""It is always better for controversial nominees such as this one to go through the proper channels,"" Chambliss said. Presidents have broad latitude to make appointments during recess, but the appointee can serve only through the end of the next session of Congress, in this case probably December 2011, when he or she must be confirmed by the Senate. Obama is hardly the only president to use such powers to appoint nominees who couldn't pass muster in the Senate. In 2005, Bush used a recess appointment to install John Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations, over the objections of Senate Democrats. Obama made six total recess appointments on Wednesday, including new ambassadors to Turkey, the Czech Republic and Azerbaijan. Various members of the Senate had blocked votes on each of the nominees for a wide variety of reasons. blakea@washpost.com"
63,The Middle East Reporter (MER),2010-09-23,LEBANON-POLITICS,,597,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,EDITORIAL; Lebanon; Pg. A12,"July 28, 2010",217 words,"--Saudi Arabia and Syria Step In to Defuse Political Tensions --Assad Calls Hariri as Saudi Ambassador Meets Hizbullah Team --Rival Factions' Conflicting Attitudes Cast Doubt About Calm Saudi Arabia and Syria, which wield considerable influence on rival Lebanese factions, have stepped in to defuse spiraling political tensions between the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri and the powerful Shiite Hizbullah group over the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL), the Beirut media reported on Thursday. However, both the pro-government AN NAHAR newspaper and the leftist daily AS SAFIR, which is close to Hizbullah, said that the current lull in the war of words between Hizbullah and the Hariri camp can be shattered at any time if both sides stick to their diametrically opposed positions. They are at odds over the STL's impending indictment into the 2005 assassination of Hariri's father, former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, and the issue of ""false witnesses"" who allegedly misled the UN investigation. AN NAHAR, quoting unnamed senior political sources, said that Saudi Arabia and Syria are playing ""a new effective role"" to reduce the political escalation and prevent the situation from spinning out of control. However, the prevailing impression is that the current calm is circumstantial and temporary as long as major divisive issues related to the STL are unsolvable, the paper quoted the sources as saying. While Hizbullah has dismissed the STL as an ""Israeli project"" designed to target it, Hariri and his allies in the Western-backed March 14 coalition have upheld support for the UN-appointed tribunal, which is probing and trying suspects in the assassination of Hariri's father. AS SAFIR said that both Hariri's Future Movement and Hizbullah agree that the relative calm is not protected by political support from the rival factions. Some factions see the current calm as the lull before the storm of the STL's indictment, the paper said. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad spoke with Hariri by telephone Wednesday night to discuss ""bilateral relations between the two brotherly countries and regional developments,"" according to a statement issued by Hariri's office, which was published by local newspapers on Thursday. No further details were given. Hizbullah, Saudi A Hizbullah delegation, led by Sheikh Hassan Ezzeddine, the group's Arab relations officer, visited the Saudi Embassy on Wednesday and held talks with Ambassador Ali Awadh Assiri. Assiri told the delegation that the embassy's doors are open to all Lebanese factions, saying that Saudi Arabia is always ready to work for the benefit of Lebanon. He urged Lebanese factions to agree on ""a Lebanese plan"" to cope with the repercussions of the STL's indictment into Hariri's killing in order to preserve stability in Lebanon. ""The international tribunal is an internal Lebanese affair,"" Assiri said in a statement published by AN NAHAR and AS SAFIR on Thursday. ""All Lebanese factions must study this important situation in a constructive dialogue to ensure cooperation to confront the repercussions of any indictment that might be issued by the tribunal."" There are fears of sectarian strife in Lebanon if the STL indicts some Hizbullah members in Hariri's murder. Hizbullah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has repeatedly declared that he does not trust the STL, which he has dismissed as an ""Israeli project"" designed to target his group by inciting sectarian strife in Lebanon. He has vowed to reject any STL indictment that accuses any Hizbullah member of involvement in Hariri's killing. On Wednesday, Nasrallah was reported to have demanded the abolition of the STL. (See MER 22/9/2010) AS SAFIR quoted unnamed senior Hizbullah sources as saying that the delegation's visit to the Saudi Embassy was not at Nasrallah's request. The delegation did not carry any political message from the Hizbullah leadership to the Saudi government. The visit was part of routine meetings held between Hizbullah and the Saudi ambassador and it coincided with fast-moving developments in Lebanon, the paper quoted the sources as saying. Saudi Arabia and Syria are major players in Lebanon's internal politics. While Saudi Arabia backs Hariri's ruling coalition and his allies in the Western-backed March 14 coalition, Syria supports Hizbullah and its allies. Syria and Saudi Arabia reconciled last year after years of strained ties over Lebanon. In the past the two country's have intervened to reduce tensions among rival Lebanese factions. The latest crisis between Hizbullah and Hariri's parliamentary Future bloc MPs erupted last Saturday when the militant group sent dozens of its security agents to storm Beirut International Airport to receive former Public Security chief Gen. Jamil al-Sayyed on his return from France in a show of massive support for a man wanted for questioning. Hizbullah's move evoked a strong and angry reaction by the ruling coalition and Hariri's Future bloc MPs, who accused the group of carrying out a premeditated ""plot"" to seize control of state institutions, beginning with the airport. (See MER 20/9/2010). Sayyed has been summoned for questioning by Prosecutor General Said Mirza on charges of threatening Hariri during a press conference on September 12. Hariri chaired a meeting of his parliamentary Future bloc on Wednesday, the third since he returned to Beirut three days ago, to discuss the political escalation with Hizbullah. The meeting stressed the need to strengthen calm in the country, AN NAHAR quoted sources close to the bloc as saying. The participants confirmed that the Syrian-Saudi protection of Lebanon is continuing, the sources said. ""False Witnesses"" Meanwhile, in an interview with AS SAFIR on Thursday, Druze leader Walid Jumblat, who had played a role in defusing the Hariri-Hizbullah tensions, called on the Lebanese judiciary to bring ""false witnesses"" to account. The paper said that the issue of ""false witnesses"" has become an inflammable item that can start a big fire in Lebanon at any time. ""It is important (for rival factions) to comply with the calm as a gateway to engaging in a political debate in a calm atmosphere on how to jointly confront the issues of false witnesses and the (STL's) indictment,"" Jumblat said. ""We have agreed in principle that there are false witnesses. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the Lebanese judiciary to bring them to account and to deal with this issue to the end,"" he added. Nasrallah has repeatedly called on the government to arrest and investigate people who allegedly misled the UN probe into Hariri's assassination by giving false testimonies. Hizbullah MPs have in the past few days reiterated that prosecuting ""false witnesses"" is the key to reaching the truth behind Hariri's assassination. In an interview with the Saudi-owned newspaper ASHARQ AL AWSAT on September 6, PM Hariri blamed what he called ""false witnesses"" for misleading the UN investigation and damaging Lebanese-Syrian relations. He also said that he made a mistake when he accused Syria of involvement in his father's assassination. (See MER 6/9/2010). March 14 Alliance The General Secretariat of the pro-government March 14 alliance said Wednesday, ""Nothing will be able to break our unity, and threats issued by some groups in Lebanon will not intimidate us because will keep on marching on the path that leads to freedom and independence,"" the Beirut daily AN NAHAR reported Thursday. The March 14 coalition said in a statement issued after its weekly meeting Wednesday, and carried by AN NAHAR, that Hizbullah ""sought to overthrow the government"". The March 14 alliance said, ""On Saturday Hizbullah invaded the airport where we saw large numbers of its security members, militia members and cars that carried no license plates."" When Hizbullah members drove into the tarmac to meet Sayyed, Lebanese security men stood watching. (See MER 20/9/2010). Sayyed was jailed in 2005 along with other three generals who were accused of their involvement in the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Hariri. The four generals were released in 2009 after it turned out that there was insufficient evidence to keep them in prison. Sayyed has recently launched a political campaign against Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri (son of Rafik al-Hariri) calling on him to annul the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) ""Hizbullah's behavior on Saturday challenged the government's existence: To be or not to be. What happened at the airport was that militant guerillas sought to target the state."" March 14 refused to consider that what is happening on the Lebanese political landscape is a ""sectarian confrontation"". ""What is happening these days can be described as a confrontation between those who support the government and those who do not."" 64 of 266 DOCUMENTS The Globe and Mail (Canada) August 3, 2010 Tuesday Isolating Hezbollah Syria's and Saudi Arabia's combined stand against terrorism in Lebanon is an encouraging sign from two Middle Eastern powers, which for a long time were rivals in the tortuous politics of that chronically unstable country. This hopeful development comes at a time when there has otherwise been little movement toward settlements of conflicts in the region. King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and Bashar al-Assad, the President of Syria, first met in Damascus, where they spoke of concord, and then proceeded together to Beirut on Friday. The apparent context is the expected announcement of indictments against members of Hezbollah, the terrorist Shiite faction in Lebanon, for the murder of Rafik Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister, in 2005. In the aftermath of that assassination, the prime suspects were members of the Syrian security agency, possibly with some connivance from Mr. al-Assad himself. Mr. Hariri had been heavily backed by Saudi Arabia in the reconstruction of Lebanon. The histories of the Syrian and Saudi regimes are very different, making the meeting of these two authoritarian rulers something of a surprise. Mr. al-Assad's second-generation family dictatorship evolved from the rule of the secularist, state-socialist Baathist party, whereas Saudi Arabia is governed by a hereditary dynasty based on harsh religious fundamentalism. United Nations investigators in the Special Tribunal for Lebanon have reportedly identified the assassins of Mr. Hariri as followers of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, whose dominance of much of southern Lebanon presents a continual danger of war with Israel. Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza both amount to terrorist statelets that are clients of Iran - which constitutes part of the wider and worrying regional context. The Syrian government itself is heavily dependent on Iranian funding, but may yet be willing to be weaned off it. The seemingly imminent charges against Hezbollah members - whether they are ""rogue elements"" of that religious sect/political party or not - may indeed destabilize the shaky ""unity"" government that includes Hezbollah - and in which Mr. Hariri's son Saad is the prime minister. Tensions are also rising on the Israeli-Lebanese border. Thus, the probable murder charges will up the ante in and around Lebanon, but the rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Syria is a constructive and promising step that may prevent new outbreaks of violence in the Middle East. 65 of 266 DOCUMENTS BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring July 28, 2010 Wednesday Official praises Syria's foreign policy over last decade Text of report in English by state-run Syrian news agency SANA website [""Mikdad: Success of Syrian Foreign Policy Based on Adherence To Standards, Arab Joint Action"" - SANA Headline] Damascus - Deputy Foreign Minister Dr Fayssal Mikdad [Faysal Miqdad] affirmed on Tuesday [27 July] that the success of Syria's foreign policy during the last ten years was based on adherence to national principles standards, independent decision-making, establishing regional and international alliances, and commitment to the unity of Arab joint action.

66,Daily News Egypt,2010-12-30,"Obama names envoy to Syria, bypassing Congress",,11,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"March 16, 2010",317 words,"Obama took the controversial step of forcing through the appointments of Ambassador Robert Ford and five other officials while the Senate which normally needs to confirm nominations was out of session. A senior administration official traveling with Obama on vacation in Hawaii justified the recess appointments, which came despite talk of cooperation with Republicans in the waning days of the last Congress. ""All administrations face delays in getting some of their nominees confirmed, but the extent of Republican obstruction of Obama nominees is unprecedented,"" the official said on condition of anonymity. The United States withdrew its ambassador to Damascus after Lebanon's former prime minister Rafiq Hariri was killed in February 2005 in a bombing blamed on Syria. Obama announced his desire to put a new ambassador in Syria in 2009 and named Ford in February this year, advancing his policy of reaching out even to adversaries of the United States. The administration sees Syria as a crucial link in diplomatic efforts to negotiate peace in the Middle East and has hoped to step up intelligence cooperation with Syria. But Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican who will head the House Foreign Affairs Committee next month after her party swept mid-term elections, accused Obama of offering concessions to a country that is ""destabilizing"" Lebanon where it backs the Hezbollah. ""Making underserved concessions to Syria tells the regime in Damascus that it can continue to pursue its dangerous agenda and not face any consequences from the US,"" the Florida lawmaker said. ""That is the wrong message to be sending to a regime which continues to harm and threaten US interests and those of such critical allies as Israel,"" she said. But Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Ford can make clear to Syria ""that there are consequences for their actions, good and bad."" ""I think we're better off with many difficult countries when we're in their face, not when we ignore them,"" he said. Mohamad Bazzi, an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said: ""If the United States only sent its envoys to friendly or compliant countries, there would be far fewer US embassies in the world."" While criticizing the appointment, Republicans have not questioned the qualifications of Ford, a veteran diplomat in the Arab world who has served as ambassador to Algeria and held senior posts in the US embassy in Baghdad. Obama also rammed through the appointments of US ambassadors to Turkey, Azerbaijan and the Czech Republic and two other administration officials. Republicans had opposed the nomination of Francis Ricciardone to be ambassador to Turkey, saying he was too soft on promoting democratic rights during a previous stint as ambassador to Egypt. On the domestic front, Obama appointed James Cole to be deputy attorney general. The Justice Department's number two position has been vacant for nearly half a year as Republicans prevented a vote. Republicans have grilled Cole over his views on treatment of terrorism suspects as well as his role as an independent consultant to AIG before the insurance company collapsed and received a government bailout. The Obama administration official said that the six nominees had waited on average 114 days for a vote in the Senate. Obama had 79 nominees pending when Congress adjourned last week and has now made 28 recess appointments, according to the official. At the same time in his tenure, former president George W. Bush had made 23 recess appointments and had six nominees awaiting a vote, the official said.

69,"Trend News Agency, Baku, Azerbaijan                  Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News",2010-10-07,Turkish expert: Turkish foreign policy has achieved greatest success in Middle East,,1AZ,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS,"October 8, 2010",578 words,"Oct. 07--Turkey's foreign policy ""zero problems with neighbors"" appeared more successful and fruitful in the development of relations between Ankara and Middle Eastern countries, especially Syria, said Turkish analyst Mitat Chelikpasha. ""Yet the Turkish policy has achieved success with Syria, but this process has not finished, it will take time,"" Chelikpasha, dean of the faculty of international relations at the University of Kadir Has, told Trend. According to him, Turkish foreign policy achieved considerable success in Iraq, but the future of Turkish-Iraqi relations is unknown because of political instability, given that six months after the elections, a government has not yet been formed in Iraq. Speaking about relations between Turkey and Israel, which have deteriorated considerably over recent years, Chelikpasha believes that in future it could create a problem for Ankara in the next steps in the Middle East. ""For this, it needs to reconsider either the Israeli or the Turkish politics. There is no understanding between the two governments,"" Chelikpasha believes. The relations between the two military and strategic allies have sharply deteriorated after the naval forces of Israel have detained six ships ""Freedom of Flotilla"" in the end of May, which carried humanitarian aid to Gaza, blockaded by Israeli forces. As a result of boarding by Israeli navy, nine activists of the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara were killed. Turkey has demanded the Israeli leadership to apologize for the attack on the humanitarian ship and pay compensation to families of those killed, but Israel has categorically refused. To investigate the incident, the UN has established an independent commission chaired by former Prime Minister of New Zealand Geoffrey Palmer. In parallel, Israel has launched a commission under the patronage of former Judge James Turkel. While Turkey has focused on expanding cooperation with Arab countries, however, according to the analyst, the Turkish role in the Middle East should not be restricted with this. Chelikpasha believes that the Israeli leadership needs to reconsider its policy in the region, because in this way the regional issues remain unresolved. Two years ago, Ankara acted as an international mediator in indirect talks between Israel and Syria, which stopped in December 2008 after the Israeli army launched large-scale military operations in Gaza. In an interview with Turkish television on Wednesday, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad mentioned Damascus's readiness to resume negotiations with Israel under Turkish mediation. At the same time, Syria demands guarantees of full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights occupied in 1967. In its turn, Israel insists on negotiations without preconditions, but says if Syria wants peace, it must distance itself from Iran and stop supporting the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah. In its turn, in Ankara confirms the desire to continue the mission of mediator. Do you have any feedback?

70,The Jerusalem Post,2010-04-15,Senate c'ttee supports nominee for ambassador to Syria,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,NEWS; Pg. 2,"April 18, 2010",264 words,"WASHINGTON - The Obama administration's nominee for ambassador to Syria received a majority in a vote by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Tuesday, despite allegations that Syria was transferring high-level weaponry to Hizbullah. The committee approval, which was carried out by a voice rather than recorded vote, means that nominee Robert Ford now needs to be approved by the full Senate. It's not clear the extent to which the reports about a Scud missile shipment from Damascus to Hizbullah could jeopardize the nomination, if at all. The White House says it condemned the shipment, and that it had raised concerns about the situation with Syria. While some Hill staffers indicated the Scud story would raise question marks that could delay the process, others noted backing for returning an ambassador to Syria and widespread support for Ford personally. Several Republican senators have signed on to a letter demanding the administration provide reporting about activity connected to WMD capability transfer to Syria as mandated by law before they would approve Ford, though lack of unanimous consent doesn't automatically sabotage the nomination. Also Tuesday, more than three-quarters of the Senate signed a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stressing the importance of US-Israel relations. The senators write that the US ""must never forget the depth and breadth of our alliance and always do our utmost to reinforce a relationship that has benefited both nations for more than six decades."" The letter was strongly supported by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee."
71,The Daily Star (Lebanon),2010-01-13,Making use of our Turkish ties,,23,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"March 30, 2010",872  words,"The ""zero conflict"" approach of Turkish foreign policy has generated a number of concrete agreements and understandings in our region. The policy, authored by Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, has been supported enthusiastically by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has hosted his Lebanese counterpart this week for several days of discussions: Editorial The ""zero conflict"" approach of Turkish foreign policy has generated a number of concrete agreements and understandings in our region. The policy, authored by Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, has been supported enthusiastically by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has hosted his Lebanese counterpart this week for several days of discussions; the two men have endorsed a series of measures that should give a much-needed boost to our bilateral relations with Ankara. Turkey's policy of reaching out to its neighbors isn't about altruism, but the country's drive to become the second most important conduit of oil to Europe, through the Nabucco pipeline. Turkey has also been particularly energetic with its southern neighbor, Syria, as evidenced by the recent rapprochement between Damascus and Ankara. Syria under Bashar Assad has pledged to cede sovereignty over the disputed province of Alexandretta, while Turkish officials have moved relatively quickly to open borders and their economy to the Syrians. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri's visit to Turkey doesn't mark the beginning of a new phase of Turkish relations with Lebanon. Turkey has been instrumental in our domestic situation for several years, and particularly in the aftermath of the civil strife of May 2008, as symbolized by Erdogan's presence present at the side of the Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani when Michel Sleiman was elected president. But our own domestic fragmentation has prevented us from making full ""use"" of our Turkish connection. And given Lebanon's problematic relations with Syria, having a third party in the mix involves multiple benefits for us. At the broader political level, Turkey is an intriguing model for Lebanon, since it's the most ""civil""-oriented state in the region, and this is particularly important when Lebanese grapple with the whole notion of abolishing sectarianism in politics. At the more practical level, we can help ""sell"" Turkey economically in the region, and create initiatives that join Turkey, Syria and ourselves into a more dynamic economic relationship. There is the potential for establishing free zones - whether it's industry, commerce, IT or the media - so that all three sides benefit. The cities of Beirut, Damascus and Ankara might not require huge initiatives, but the vast areas outside these capital cities certainly need investment and development. Erdogan will not last forever in Turkey, thanks to its democratic system, meaning that Hariri must act quickly to forge a beneficial and savvy approach to Turkey and Syria. It doesn't have to be a grand, overarching alliance, which would cause anxiety elsewhere in the Arab world, but it certainly won't create itself. We must conduct assessments and studies and build our approach systematically, and energetically, or else risk asking in a few years' time about yet another promising opportunity that fell by the wayside. 72 of 266 DOCUMENTS Right Vision News March 31, 2010 Wednesday DUBAI, March 31 -- The victory of Ayad Allawi proved that Iraqis have grown aware that sectarianism was the greatest risk threatening the stability of their country, wrote Sallah al Qallab in a comment article for the Kuwaiti newspaper Al Jareeda. According to our correspondent, the election crowned the success of a non-sectarian alliance approach. ""Mr Allawi is Shiite, an Arab nationalist and also secular. But he earned the trust of Sunni voters, other nationalists and also various Iraqis from different ends of the social spectrum. This is why it is possible to conclude an agreement with Kurdistan's political forces, mainly Jalal Talabani and Massoud Barzani, which potentially could help avoid future divisions."" The present prime minister Nouri al Maliki is less likely to maintain his position as head of the government and his sectarian appeal is fading away. This started two years ago when the Iraqi army launched an operation against the Mahdi militia. Now that the election has brought a new political reality, it is time for Mr Allawi to continue along the non-sectarian path in order to form a ""national salvation government"". This would require him to forget past feuds and open the door for both Mr al Maliki and the Kurdish alliances to ensure an optimal atmosphere for Iraq to address future challenges. Arabs should seek more alternatives ""The Arab League secretary general, Amr Moussa, has asked whether the stalled peace process in the Middle East is still relevant after the Israeli government has appeared unwilling to pursue a peace conducive to establishing the two-state solution,"" the UAE newspaper Akhbar Al Arab wrote in its editorial. This call does not urge Arabs to declare war, but invites them to think of means other than negotiations, especially after the US appears less committed to imposing pressure on Israel to halt settlement expansion. Among the alternatives is to provide support to the Palestinians, and especially to the popular resistance. Is not that a better choice than waiting until the Israeli government occupies the rest of the land? Is not severing ties with Israel better than the irresponsible actions of the Israeli government, which has assumed that Arabs are not able to exercise their role on the Palestinian issue? There are many alternatives but the foremost is to break relations with Israel and boycott normalisation. Encouraging national reconciliation is the right step to empower Palestinians in order to engage in a political battle against the Israelis. This should serve as an alternative that replaces past Arab policies aimed at forcing Palestinians to enter into talks with the Israelis. Stronger relations with Syria will help Lebanon ""In his latest statement, the Syrian president Bashar Assad reaffirmed his country's view of Lebanon as a fully sovereign state, and that Damascus has no intention to interfere in its internal affairs,"" wrote Bassam al Dhaw in an opinion piece for the Qatari newspaper Al Watan. ""Syria, he said, is interested in promoting co-operation with Lebanon in regard to Arab, regional and international issues."" Mr Assad has demonstrated a sensible and realistic policy, which Lebanon needs. In fact, it will benefit Beirut more than Damascus as it has suffered from years of mutual animosity incited by the US, which resulted in tragic developments. The present rapprochement between Beirut and Damascus confirmed a growing awareness of the special situation of Lebanon, and this was clearly stated by Mr Assad when he said that Syria did not not want to meddle in Lebanese affairs but to encourage co-operation. ""As observers, we can expect stronger relations between Syria and Lebanon soon, and local Lebanese forces are likely to engage in new relations with a new political discourse that considers Syria and Lebanon as partners."" Saudi press has scored solid achievements Mohammed Sadiq Diyab, in a comment for the London-based newspaper Asharq al Awsat, described press freedom as valuing credibility, a rational attitude and objectivity, and avoiding sensationalism. ""This way the press can fairly report to the community what is happening, and how and why an event happened. If we consider the Saudi press as an example, we can see that it has managed in recent years to play a vital role in providing coverage on many core issues, such as extremism, corruption, bureaucracy, justice and human rights."" This has led many to believe in the important role of the press as a platform to express opinions. ""And I believe the Saudi leadership is proud about the achievements of the Saudi press."" With the existence of a free and responsible press, public servants who are performing well will feel empowered, while the ones not performing well will feel they are under a system of accountability. Freedom of press governed by law and ethics will encourage more commitment to excellence. ""I say this not only to hail the success of the Saudi press but also to point to this promising experience which can develop further in the future and be a sound tool for development.""

73,The Bismarck Tribune,2010-03-10,Mostly hope,,,Transcript,,PATRICK MARTIN,ENGLISH,INTERNATIONAL NEWS; POLITICS / MIDDLE EAST; Pg. A12,"October 2, 2010",208 words,"After more than a year in office, the Obama foreign policy based on hope has run its course. Time after time, the administration has pursued a policy of pre-emptive concession rather than hard bargaining, with predictable results. In Europe, the U.S. simply walked away from a defensive missile shield in an effort to hit the ""restart"" button with Russia. Our allies, Poland and the Czech Republic, who had counted on our commitment, were hung out to dry. In the Middle East, the U.S. has hectored our best ally in the region, Israel, while assiduously courting Syria. The ""open hand"" that was so flamboyantly extended to Iran was also offered to Syria. Bashar al-Assad didn't get a videotaped New Year's message from the president, as the mullahs did, but a procession of high-ranking diplomats has trooped to Damascus to offer better relations, trade agreements, and diplomatic recognition. Without preconditions, the administration decided to name a U.S. ambassador to Syria for the first time since 2005, when the U.S. withdrew its ambassador to protest Syria's role in the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. The administration might have asked for any number of commitments in exchange -- an end to support for insurgents in Iraq or cutting off aid to Hezbollah and Hamas - but it chose hope instead. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did make one request, though - that Syria reciprocate for these gestures by distancing itself from Iran. Last week, al-Assad responded. Hosting Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in Damascus, al-Assad ostentatiously signed a treaty of friendship with Iran and said of the secretary of state's request, ""I find it strange how they talk about Middle East stability and at the same time talk about dividing two countries."" Further mocking her, al-Assad joked, ""We must have understood Clinton wrong because of bad translation or our limited understanding, so we signed the agreement."" The administration has been similarly accommodating toward China, starting with Secretary Clinton's February 2009 declaration that human rights issues in China ""can't interfere with the global economic crisis, the global climate change crisis, and the security crisis."" The president followed up by declining to see the Dalai Lama before his November trip to China (though, he did finally host him last month). While there, Obama tamely agreed to speak before an audience of carefully chosen communist party students, without any assurance that his comments would be broadcast live. The president's defenders argued that the soft approach to China would yield dividends in other areas - such as Chinese support for tough sanctions against Iran. That fond expectation is now being tested. Late, very late, the Obama administration has gotten around to the arduous process of pursuing sanctions on Iran. In May 2009, the president said ""we're not going to have talks forever"" and estimated that ""by the end of the year,"" he'd re-evaluate. In July, watching the regime's thugs shoot down protesters in the streets, he accelerated the timetable slightly, saying that the Iranians would need to prove their bona fides by September. Something did happen in September: Word reached Obama and other world leaders that Iran had built a secret nuclear enrichment facility outside the city of Qom. The president was scheduled to address the United Nations on Sept. 24 and preside over the Security Council the next day. It would have been a perfect moment to confront Iran about its duplicity, abandon the policy of ""engagement,"" and rally international support, as French president Nicolas Sarkozy urged. But the president said nothing. He didn't want the ""diversion"" of Iran to detract attention from his nuclear disarmament message. This prompted Charles Krauthammer to note the president's achievement in getting to France's left on foreign policy. Now the administration is hoping to get United Nations backing for a series of sanctions reportedly including choking off access to international credit and limiting oil exports. Are the Russians and Chinese on board? Spokesman Robert Gibbs has been long on hope, touting ""the resolve and unity of the international community with regard to Iran's nuclear program."" But this week, the Chinese told the Security Council that there is still room for diplomacy, and the Russians advised that there is ""still a horizon"" for negotiations. This is what comes of using a smile for your umbrella. (Mona Charen's syndicated column appears in the Tribune on Wednesdays.) 74 of 266 DOCUMENTS The Globe and Mail (Canada) July 31, 2010 Saturday A sign of solidarity for the sake of Lebanon's future; As tensions rise over imminent UN report on Hariri assassination, Syrian, Saudi leaders attend summit with Lebanese officials It takes about five minutes to fly the 85 kilometres from Damascus to Beirut, but it took Syrian President Bashar al-Assad five years to make the flight - five years plus the guiding hand of Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah on whose plane the two leaders flew Friday for a historic lunch with the leaders of Lebanon. The two men went to signal they were united in wanting Lebanon to remain stable and to resist those who might want to resume the kind of civil war for which Lebanon once was synonymous. It was the first time a Saudi monarch had visited Lebanon since 1957, and the first time Mr. al-Assad has been in Beirut since the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri, a murder he was initially accused of having ordered. The international furor over that killing forced Syria to withdraw the forces it had maintained in Lebanon since 1990 when they were used to help secure an end to Lebanon's 15-year civil war. Saudi Arabia and Syria, the power brokers behind Prime Minister Saad Hariri and Hezbollah Leader Hassan Nasrallah respectively, are concerned over what may happen when the UN Special Tribunal for Lebanon investigating the Hariri assassination brings down indictments. If the tribunal, headed by Canadian chief prosecutor Daniel Bellemare, points the finger at militant Shia movement Hezbollah, as expected, some fear Lebanon could be plunged back into the kind of deadly chaos that gripped the country between 2006 and 2008, when Hezbollah fighters took to the streets demanding a greater share of political power. Last week Sheikh Nasrallah revealed his belief that the UN tribunal was poised to indict members of his party. He made it clear he would not accept such a finding and accused the tribunal of being part of an Israeli plot. ""If Hezbollah reacts aggressively to any indictment, it will destabilize the country and spill over into the region,"" says Karim Makdisi, a professor of political science at the American University of Beirut. Friday's luncheon summit was ""intended to signal to Hezbollah that it will be in its own best interest not to over-react,"" he said. ""Hezbollah needs to remember how bad the situation was in Lebanon from 2004 to 2008,"" Prof. Makdisi said. ""It has nothing to gain by dragging the country back to that."" ""If Israel couldn't eliminate it militarily, if the U.S. couldn't oust it politically and if March 14 [Lebanon's anti-Hezbollah coalition led by Saad Hariri] couldn't defeat it internally, Hezbollah isn't going away. It's part of the political fabric,"" he said. Interestingly, the Emir of Qatar, who, like Mr. al-Assad, is close to Iran, arrived in the Lebanese capital Friday, just after the Saudi plane departed. He is visiting for a couple days and will travel to the Shia south of the country. It is unclear if he will deliver a message to encourage defiance by Hezbollah. Originally struck as a means of liberating Lebanon from the clutches of political gangsters, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon has been something of a disappointment. ""It's been a disaster, as far as most Lebanese are concerned,"" said Prof. Makdisi. ""It's viewed here as completely politicized."" But how could that be, with a Canadian running the show? ""These days, having a Canadian in charge is no guarantee of impartiality,"" said Prof. Makdisi. ""We know where Canada stands when it comes to the Middle East. People see this tribunal as strictly an American-Israeli exercise."" Citing leaks from the tribunal, Israeli TV reported Thursday that Mustafa Badr al-Din, the brother-in-law of Imad Mughniyeh, the Hezbollah commander believed to have been assassinated by Israel two years ago, was responsible for the Hariri killing. Allegations that Hezbollah was involved in Mr. Hariri's assassination first appeared in a 2009 article in the German news magazine Der Spiegel. It reported that investigators had found a link between cell phones used in the area of the attack and other phones belonging to Hezbollah's ""operative arm."" Hezbollah and its allies repeatedly have criticized what they say is the politicization of the tribunal, arguing that the inquiry has been weakened by the use of information based on Israeli-compromised communications systems. Last Thursday, Sheikh Nasrallah attacked the tribunal for not considering the possibility that Israel ordered the hit. ""In as much as it failed to take this hypothesis into consideration, then the [tribunal] cannot be considered unprejudiced,"" the Hezbollah leader said. Might Saad Hariri, whose father was killed in the 2005 attack, also react strongly to any indictment? ""It's taken a number of years for him to appreciate the difference between Hariri the son, and Hariri the Prime Minister - someone who is responsible for social stability in an unstable country,"" said Prof. Makdisi. ""A lot of people in his movement definitely want to get revenge on Hezbollah,"" he added. ""But Saad has to resist that tendency. With Saudi Arabia in his corner, he should be able to ride it out."" ""The future of Lebanon is at stake."" 75 of 266 DOCUMENTS BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring October 2, 2010 Saturday Syrian, US officials discuss bilateral ties, Middle East peace process Text of report in English by state-run Syrian news agency SANA website [""Mikdad Meets Several U.S Officials from the Department of State"" --SANA Headline] Washington, (SANA) - Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faysal Mikdad met several US officials from the US Department of State and members from the US Congress during his visit to Washington DC after his participation in the 65th session of the UN General Assembly's meetings.

The Lebanese leader attended meetings Sunday with other Iranian officials, including first Vice President Mohammed Reza Rahimi and Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki. Reports in the Lebanese media Monday said the most significant result of the Tehran talks was agreement on state-to-state cooperation. This was taken as an indication of agreement between the two sides to cooperate directly without the intervention of a third party, such as Hizbullah the Lebanese Shiite militant group backed by Iran. The reports said the two sides made no mention of Hizbullah during the talks. The party leads the opposition, which is backed by Iran. Hariri also secured Iran's support for current diplomatic efforts aimed at maintaining stability and clam in Lebanon as conflict rages over the U.N.-appointed Special Tribunal of Lebanon. However, today's reports said that Iran's view on the STL differed from Hariri in that Tehran believed the STL was detrimental to peace and stability in Lebanon. Hariri met Iran's defense minister Sunday, stressing that unity between Arab states and Iran against common threats was of """"great importance."""" Lebanon would continue its """"resistance"""" to Israel, Hariri also said Sunday, a month after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made the first official visit to Lebanon by an Iranian president. Hariri's visit is partly to seek Iran's help to prevent political tensions turning violent if a U.N.-backed tribunal indicts members of Iran-and-Syria -supported Hizbullah for killing his father. """"The stability, security and unity of Lebanon play a key role in resolving internal and regional issues. Based on that, I was willing to come to Iran and see your defensive military achievements although it was against the opinion of our enemies,"""" Hariri told reporters at a military exhibition. """"Lebanon has resisted the Zionist regime until now and will continue the resistance,"""" he said. """"Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Iran have always been surrounded by danger. Therefore, unity between the Arabs and Iran is a matter of great importance."""" Iran also sees Israel as a threat. The Jewish state has said it does not rule out a military strike against Iran, if necessary, to stop it getting nuclear weapons. AL MUSTAQBAL newspaper, organ of Hariri's Future Movement, reported Monday that the prime minister has no plans for a visit to Syria soon."" Neither are circumstances favorable at present for a meeting between Hariri and Hizbullah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. The newspaper said, however, that relations between Hariri and the Syrian regime ""are positive and excellent in spite of those in Lebanon who are upset by this development."" Iranian leaders reportedly assured Hariri that stability in Lebanon serves the interests of Iran as well. This was taken to imply Iran supports the diplomatic efforts by Syria and Saudi Arabia in that direction. Iran and Hariri have expressed a common interest in ""preventing a confessional conflict"" between Muslim Shiite and Muslim Sunnis over the STL and its anticipated indictments. As regards politics at home, the media ruled an early meeting of the council of ministers and an early meeting of the national dialogue committee before an acceptable formula is reached for settlement of the conflict on the STL and the ""false witnesses"" issue. Hariri also met Iran's defense minister Ahamad Vahidi Sunday, stressing that unity between Arab states and Iran against common threats was of """"great importance."""" """"The stability, security and unity of Lebanon play a key role in resolving internal and regional issues. Based on that, I was willing to come to Iran and see your defensive military achievements although it was against the opinion of our enemies,"""" Hariri told reporters, according to state broadcaster IRIB's website, and carried by Reuters. """"Lebanon has resisted the Zionist regime until now and will continue the resistance,"""" he said on the sidelines of his visit to a military exhibition. """"Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Iran have always been surrounded by danger. Therefore, unity between the Arabs and Iran is a matter of great importance."""" In a 2006 war with Israel, 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in Lebanon, along with 158 Israelis, mostly soldiers. In August a senior Israeli officer, two Lebanese soldiers and a Lebanese journalist were killed in a rare skirmish that raised fears of wider conflict. Vahidi gave Hariri a domestically-manufactured Tondar (Thunder) machinegun as a gift. 78 of 266 DOCUMENTS Trend News Agency, Baku, Azerbaijan Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News November 5, 2010 Friday Experts: Victory of Republicans not to affect Washington's policy on Iran Nov. 05--The victory of Republicans in the midterm elections in the U.S. Congress will likely not affect the policies of Washington towards Iran, but the Obama administration can not avoid serious pressure from their side, experts say. ""I don't believe that the Republican controlled House will make much difference to America's Iran Policy. The president is in charge of foreign policy,"" Joshua Landis, Director of the Center for Middle East Studies at American University of Oklahoma, wrote in an e-mail to Trend. According to the results of the midterm elections, held in the U.S. November 2, the Republican Party won an overwhelming majority in the lower house of Congress (House of Representatives). According to the last counting of votes, the Republicans will take 239 and the Democrats -- 183 seats in the lower house of parliament. The Democrats preserved a majority in the Senate, but lost in six states, including Illinois. Earlier, Obama was elected from this state. According to Landis, the same people in the National Security Council and Treasury department will be overseeing sanctions. After the UN Security Council adopted a resolution on June 9 1929 on introduction of the fourth package of sanctions against Iran from 2006, the U.S. Congress adopted a bill on unilateral anti-Iran sanctions on June 24. According to this bill, the sanctions will be imposed on any enterprise or individual who assist Iran in the oil refinery or in the development of refining capacity, or have contacts with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, or with the Iranian banks, which are included in the list of those subject to sanctions. ""The White House runs foreign policy and there will be no change in U.S. policy on Iran,"" Barry Rubin,the director of the Global Research in International Affairs (GLORIA) Center, wrote in an e-mail to Trend. As regards policy toward Iran, most Republicans see Obama's apologetic approach to Iran as a total failure and counter-productive, Philip Carl Salzman, Professor of Anthropology at McGill University, Adjunct Fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies told Trend by e-mail. The Republicans will want a tougher and more active response to Iran, such as a return to a policy of isolation for Syria, Iran's closest ally, instead of Obama's failed attempt to beg Syria to be good, such as a more active response to Hezbollah's gobbling up of Lebanon,"" he said. Hezbollah is a Lebanese Shi'ite militant organization and political party, based on the ideology of Ruhollah Khomeini, created by the leaders of the Islamic revolution in Iran. It is considered a terrorist organization in Canada, the Netherlands, Israel, and Egypt, and partly in Australia and the UK. It receives financial and military support from Iran and Syria. In addition, Salzman, The Republicans may call on willingness to take military action as a last resort to stop Iran's military nuclearization. Despite the statement by the Iranian leadership that the nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes and covering the energy needs, the international community is concerned about the possible military component of Iran's nuclear program. The Republican's another concern is that the Obama administration has inactively looked on while Turkey turns increasingly to Iran and Syria, Salzman noted. ""The Republicans are likely to want it made clear that Turkey will pay a price for joining America's enemies,""he said. ""The Republicans will be more definite about naming Iran and Syria enemies of the United States."" Turkey, a neighbor of Iran and one of the leading countries in the region, opposed against toughening sanctions against Iran. In late March, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke against imposing new sanctions against Iran, and later, in mid April, the Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu clearly expressed his country's position, which is the reluctance of Turkey to take further sanctions. A tripartite declaration on uranium exchange was reached on May 17 between Iran, Turkey and Brazil. The foreign ministers of these three countries signed a draft agreement for the exchange of Tehran's low-enriched uranium for highly enriched uranium for Tehran's research reactor on Turkish territory. Moreover, Turkey has become one of the two UN Security Council member countries who voted against the adoption of resolution 1929, containing sanctions against Iran. Salzman think many Republicans, and a minority of Democrats, have viewed President Obama as the first Post-American President and more pro-United Nations and the international ""community"" of nations, especially the so-called ""Third World."" ""Now that they have regained significant power, the Republicans, along with some Democrat allies, will demand a stiffer, more pro-American foreign policy, and probably a more pro-active response to foreign challenges,"" Salzman said. According to the Iranian MP Ismail Kosari, if Democrats do not win the subsequent stages, the U.S. policy might change in respect of some countries and pressure could increase on them. ""Likely to establish control over Iran, the U.S. could increase pressure on it,"" Kosari, deputy chairman of the commission on national security and foreign policy of the Iranian Parliament, wrote in an e-mail to Trend. On the other hand, he said, during Bush's governance, the Republicans lost for several times, so now they can agree to cooperate with the Obama administration. ""Maybe the Republicans will be softer than Democrats, said Kosari -- in any case, it needs to await for further developments."" ""Will the Republicans succeed in stiffening Obama's backbone, and wean him from his self-image as an All-World Flower Child trying to spread the love? There will be serious pressure on Obama, but we shall have to wait and see what effect it will have,"" said Salzman. T.Jafarov contributed to the article. Do you have any feedback?

79,The Globe and Mail (Canada),2010-10-29,"How to influence friends, bribe neighbours and miff the U.S.",,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,INTERNATIONAL NEWS; FOLIO: IRAN: GEOPOLITICS; Pg. A12,"April 5, 2010",690 words,"pmartin@globeandmail.com It may be wounded by sanctions and frustrated in its nuclear ambitions, but Iran is still a force to be reckoned with in the Middle East. In an effort to shore up regional clout against the United States and Israel, it strategically plays both sides of many fences The Islamic Republic of Iran knows how things work in the Middle East and Central Asia. That's why the man who briefs Afghan President Hamid Karzai every morning receives bags of cash from Iran on a regular basis. President Karzai says it's been going on for years and is perfectly transparent. ""It is official and by my order,"" the Afghan leader said this week. Does it matter that Mr. Karzai's Taliban enemies also receive Iranian bags of cash? Not to Iran, that's how it operates. ""The Iranians are smart enough to try to use their regional position in negotiations with the Americans,"" said Adnan Abu Odeh, a former political adviser to Jordan's King Hussein and former Jordanian ambassador to the United Nations. ""They're in a position to bargain with the Americans, and they're trying to increase their bargaining power."" That's also why Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and Muqtada al-Sadr, the militant Shia leader Mr. al-Maliki sought to destroy, both receive funding and arms from Iran, and why both men are expected to share power in any forthcoming Iraqi government. ""Iran wants to be the regional hegemon, and doesn't want to leave it to some outside power like the U.S.,"" says Nader Hashemi, a professor of Islamic politics at the University of Denver. ""It's doing everything in its power to make that happen."" While many in the West may see an Iran wounded from the bite of international sanctions and frustrated in its dream of achieving nuclear power, this is exactly the time that Iran is most dangerous. ""The existential reality of Iran cannot be ignored,"" said Dr. Hashemi. ""It has interests in the region and it intends to act on them."" That's why Iran moved so quickly to shore up its presence in Lebanon recently when its powerful rival Saudi Arabia started nosing around in south Beirut. No sooner had Saudi King Abdullah and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad paid a joint visit to Lebanon this summer, in an effort to bring the militant Hezbollah movement closer to Syria and away from Iran, when Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad scheduled his own trip. He stopped first in Damascus and went on to Lebanon where he received a thunderous welcome from the country's Shiites -and from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shia militant movement, in particular. ""Ahmadinejad's visit to Lebanon was a way to exert influence and to say to others: 'We're still here and still influential,'"" said Saeed Rahnema, professor of political science at York University in Toronto. The Saudis' Lebanese ploy wouldn't have come as a surprise to Iran, says Dr. Rahnema. ""The Iranian regime believes it is surrounded by hostile, mostly pro-U.S. neighbours, which is why it's trying to develop relations and have its own influence."" It also is trying to send a message to the West that despite efforts to isolate it, Iran still has a lot of regional cards to play. When it comes to the pivotal states of Afghanistan and Iraq, it's noteworthy that Iran and the United States actually back the same sides - Mr. Karzai and Mr. al-Maliki. Though Iran adds support to some opposition elements for good tactical measure, it is not particularly fond of the Taliban. Tehran almost went to war against the Taliban in 1998 when it launched a campaign against Afghanistan's Hazara Shiites. Besides wanting to have friendly governments on its borders, Iran has a continued interest in what goes on inside these countries. ""They also want to show a little bit of the nightmare scenario they are prepared to play, should the U.S. or Israel decide to attack it over its nuclear program,"" said Dr. Hashemi. ""Iran could strike back through friendly groups in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as possibly in Lebanon and Gaza."" Israeli reports have emphasized the growing arsenals of Iranian weapons in both Lebanon and in Gaza, giving credence to the Iranian threat. Reports also have underscored how close Turkey has become to Iran in recent months, drawing particular attention to the Erdogan government's new intelligence chief who is said to lean distinctly toward Tehran. Appointed in May, Hakan Fidan wasted little time in severing Turkey's links to Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, which had been favoured by his predecessor. But a new accusation that Saudi Arabia and Iran actually are co-operating, allegedly over divvying up control in Lebanon, is a bit of a stretch. As the pre-eminent Sunni and Shia powers, these two countries will never be close - centuries of Persian-Arab wars and the Sunni tenet that Shiism is heresy preclude that possibility. ""Saudi Arabia doesn't like Iran playing any role in Lebanon, Iraq or even in Afghanistan,"" said Mr. Abu Odeh. ""But the fact that Iran is in those countries means that Saudi Arabia has to take a position that appears to be co-operative. In reality,"" he insists, ""the Saudis are determined to halt the spread of Iranian influence."" And what of the idea that Hezbollah in south Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza will behave as agents of Iran the minute Israel or the United States strikes at Tehran's nuclear facilities? Not likely. Alastair Crooke, a former MI6 analyst and author of Resistance: The Essence of the Islamist Revolution, argues that Hezbollah is far more committed to a national agenda in Lebanon and wouldn't want to jeopardize its domestic political base. ""For movements such as Hezbollah, revolution must never be allowed to overreach itself, or become detached from popular support,"" he notes. But that doesn't mean Iran can't use the threat of its support in the here and now. There's a reason why Iran's revolutionary influence reverberates throughout the Middle East, says Mr. Crooke, the founder of Conflicts Forum and a former adviser to Middle East envoy George Mitchell. Its revolution connected with the way people in this region approach life, he says. It connected to people in a way the West never will. Or, as Afghan Finance Minister Hazrat Omar Zakhilwal put it this week: ""We have no choice but to be friendly with Iran ... It's a hostile neighbourhood.""

""The Yemeni proposal is a real good one, but needs a full study by experts not only at the foreign ministers' level,"" Abu-al-Ghayt said in an interview with the Egyptian Channel 1 TV programme ""Viewpoint"" aired on 4 April. The foreign minister said a five-member committee that includes President Husni Mubarak will study changes to the joint Arab action mechanism to achieve the Yemeni proposal or that of Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhafi on creating a post for Arab political coordinator who leads the Arab foreign ministers' council and becomes part of the Arab League secretariat. Arab people should embrace the idea of unity first, Abu-al-Ghayt said, citing the tragic fallout of an Egyptian-Algerian World Cup 2010 decider in Khartoum. The top diplomat insisted that it is unacceptable that such a unity proposal gets accepted in one meeting only. ""We have to reach understandings on common grounds and prepare steps according to a plan approved by all parties and move gradually towards that end."" Arab neighbourhood Abu-al-Ghayt described as a good idea Arab League Secretary-General Amr Musa's proposal for an Arab neighbourhood. ""The proposal was made during the opening session of the Arab summit in Sirte, Libya,"" he noted. ""It is not possible that a proposal of such importance can be discussed and approved in one summit meeting."" The foreign minister noted that some countries have asked about the Islamic dimension and why not including Pakistan and Malaysia. ""So, this project needs to be studied carefully."" Abu-al-Ghayt highlighted the differences between the Greater Middle East and the Arab neighbourhood proposal. ""The Greater Middle East proposal includes Israel,"" he explains. ""It was an idea sponsored by then Israeli Premier Shimon Peres and was supported by the Europeans and the West to push for a Palestinian settlement."" The top diplomat noted that the Greater Middle East proposal ignored the African dimension. ""The Arab neighbourhood proposal does not include Israel and opposes its inclusion until a comprehensive and lasting peace is established in the region."" Turkey Abu-al-Gha yt denied any diplomatic rivalry between Egypt and Turkey. ""Turkey has worked with Arabs after the downfall of the Ottoman empire, under Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and after. ""It came today to tell Arabs that it has a political party that believes in Turkey as being part of the region and the Islamic civilization and culture,"" Abu-al-Ghayt said. ""It backs Arabs in confronting Israeli aggressions in Al-Quds [East Jerusalem] and supports Palestinian rights in Al-Quds. So, how come there could be any rivalry,"" Abu-al-Ghayt wondered. Syria Syria has tabled a proposal during the Arab summit in Sirte to settle Arab differences, said Abu-al-Ghayt. ""Who could reject such a proposal?"" On Syrian President Bashar al-Asad's wish to visit Egypt and check on President Mubarak following the medical operation he underwent in Germany, Abu-al-Ghayt said the Syrian leader was posted on the health condition of Mubarak who was under convalescence. He asserted that both countries are keen on restoring the warmth of their bilateral relations to how it was until 2006. ""In case Syria is approaching a party that could cause it or the region trouble, we would request them to take care,"" said Abu-al-Ghayt. ""We have actually done so several times."" Egypt-Qatar ties On Egypt-Qatar coordination on Sudan's updates, the foreign minister said there was no coordination, but rather participation in conferences held on Sudan as Egypt is always invited to such events. ""Egypt is a Sudan's neighbour and is affected by what is going on there."" Egypt and Qatar are in good relations, he said, maintaining that there are some differences. ""We had different view on addressing the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip and the issue of Hamas,"" Abu-al-Ghayt said. ""Yet, ties between Mubarak and the Qatari Emir are just fine.""

81,The Philadelphia Inquirer,2010-09-26,Worldview: Holdouts put politics before U.S. relations; GOP senators blocking Obama's picks thwart peace.,CITY-C Edition,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,CURRENTS; Inq Currents; Pg. C01,"September 26, 2010",761 words,"At a time when America is beset with intractable foreign policy problems, you wouldn't think Republican senators would want to make things worse. Or would you? Sen. Sam Brownback (R., Kan.) is holding up President Obama's nominee to be ambassador to Turkey, skilled career diplomat Frank Ricciardone, at an extremely sensitive time in U.S.-Turkish relations. And several Republican senators are holding up confirmation of Robert Ford as ambassador to Syria, even as Obama is promoting new Mideast peace talks that require buy-in from Arab states. The two posts remain empty at a time when deft U.S. diplomacy has never been more needed in the greater Middle East. It's hard not to conclude that these senators are so eager to trip Obama they don't care if they harm U.S. interests as well. The case of Turkey is particularly egregious. Despite strains between Washington and Ankara, Turkey remains a NATO ally and an increasingly important player in the region and in the Muslim world. Our two militaries have close relations. And Turkish President Abdullah Gul insisted last week, in New York, that ""Turkey will remain a strong ally"" of the United States. Moreover, Turkey has a strong economy and sits at the crossroads between Europe, Russia, the Caucasus, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. Its current leaders come from a political party with Muslim religious roots that has been bolstered by recent electoral successes. Yes, Turkey's ambitions can cause frictions. Its growing closeness to Iran and its overconfidence that its diplomacy can resolve the dispute over Tehran's nuclear program are worrying. Its veto of the latest U.N. sanctions on Iran angered Washington. And Turkey's deepening rift with Israel, which was once a close ally, is cause for concern. All the more reason to have Ricciardone hard at work in Ankara, trying to bridge the gap between Turks and Israelis and coordinate U.S., European, and Turkish diplomacy toward Iran. Having served three tours in Turkey and followed events there for 30 years, he can hit the ground running. ""You have to have an ambassador at this critical point in U.S.-Turkish relations,"" says Lehigh University's Henri Barkey, a specialist on the issue. ""Turkey is one of the most important countries for U.S. foreign policy, and not having an ambassador is a disaster."" So why is Brownback blocking the way? In an Aug. 16 letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the senator charged that Ricciardone had failed to bolster the democratic opposition in Egypt when he served as ambassador there in 2005-08. Surely Brownback can't be penalizing Ricciardone for following the lead of his bosses in Washington. During that period the Bush administration switched from promoting democracy in Egypt to fully backing autocratic President Hosni Mubarak as a supporter of the war on terrorism. When Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited Cairo in 2007, she didn't even mention the name of jailed opposition leader Ayman Nour. A more likely explanation is Brownback's expressed fear that Turkey is moving away from its ""secularist roots"" and that Ricciardone would give short shrift to Turkey's secular opposition parties. ""We cannot let our desire for a strong bilateral relationship translate into de facto support of the ruling party,"" the senator says. Excuse me? Turkey is not Egypt, where elections are a sham and Mubarak has held power for decades. Its government won a fair election. Any U.S. ambassador to Turkey should meet regularly with opposition leaders, especially if their rights seem threatened. But that doesn't mean we can ignore elected officials and push for a return of secular parties to power. We must deal with the Turkey we have, not the (secular) Turkey we may want, to paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld. Now, more than ever, we need an ambassador in Ankara who firmly expresses U.S. concerns but works hard to keep our relationship on track. Ditto for our approach to Damascus. The ostensible reason for the hold on Ford is that Syria has been sending missiles to Hezbollah. But when senior Israeli officials talk of the necessity of a peace deal with Damascus, why are we shying away from contacts with the Syrian regime? It makes little sense to have no ambassador in Damascus when we're embarked on a peace process in which Syria must ultimately play a role. It's time for certain Republican senators to stop gumming up U.S. diplomacy in order to hit at Obama. That's a shameful misuse of the confirmation process, and it harms our essential interests in the Middle East. E-mail Trudy Rubin at trubin@phillynews.com."

Despite occasional calibrations reflecting changes in administration, the policy of the United States toward the broader Middle East and North Africa region remains highly influenced by a set of misperceptions and ideological stances more related to American domestic politics than to regional realities. This situation has constantly undermined Washington's efforts and, occasionally, its desire to play a positive role in the region, serving to transform the US into a convenient scapegoat upon which ruling regimes heap blame for all regional woes. To further complicate matters, the misperceptions involved have long become indigenous to both US political parties, where persistent bickering serves to make officials and experts impervious to serious criticism and, consequently, unable to conduct any serious course correction. Indeed, the various actors involved in formulating American foreign policy have grown too addicted to scoring points in an ongoing ideological battle than in trying to keep up with the continuously shifting realities on the ground in the Middle East. This tendency has served to make US foreign policy highly reactive, episodic, disconnected, and subject to manipulation by outside parties whose interests and approaches often do not coincide with those of the US. Through misinformation campaigns and intensive lobbying that plays and preys on the ideological differences between the groups making or influencing policy in Washington, American friends and foes alike have, in effect, undermined Washington's ability to chart a course of action in the region that is truly commensurate with its interests. A kind of willful blindness that has become all too prevalent in certain quarters is making the situation even more desperate. It is shifting the regional focus of the US constantly from the peace process, to the war on terror, to democracy promotion, to Iran's nuclear challenge, to calls for open engagement and promises of development aid, to thoughts of gradual disengagement from the region, at least on the micro-level. Each one of these approaches has been hailed as the key to solving, if not the region's problems per se, then, at least, American problems in the region. Yet this reductionism contrasts sharply with the approach favored by America's friends and foes in the region, all of whom tend to operate on a multi-track basis. Successive governments in Israel, for instance, have for the last two decades continuously affirmed their commitment to the peace process, while simultaneously engaging in activities to undermine it, including the expansion of settlements, collective punishment, and the cutting off humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians. The Syrian regime has also perfected this fine art of stonewalling with its talk about peace and security on the one hand, and its ongoing support for all sorts of terrorist groups undermining the stability of Syria's neighbors on the other. Such behavior, by Israel, Syria, or any other regional state, which might appear contradictory at first, has, nonetheless, proven quite effective over the years in enabling the players involved in exacting concessions and creating new facts on the ground that better serve their perceived interests. Meanwhile, the US continues to pursue a single-minded path, then another, and another, before lapsing into whimsical ideas of regional disengagement like a bumbling behemoth. But the US will not be able to maneuver its way out of this situation by turning is back on a region actively engaged in exporting its turmoil to the world. There is no exit for the US from the region, and attempts at macro-managing the region's transition cannot take place in the absence of a micro-understanding of its shifting realities. America's real challenge, then, is to figure out a role for itself commensurate with its long-term strategic interests, rather than scurrying for an imaginary way out. Success in this regard, however, requires serious reevaluation of America's basic assumptions about the very issues behind its current involvement, especially the following: First, the war on terror, where the US focus on military solutions and security alliances with authoritarian regimes has played right into the hands of the terrorists and the corrupt regimes that support them; Second, the Arab-Israeli conflict, that has recently evolved into a regional struggle for realignment involving Iran and Turkey, and to a lesser extent India and Pakistan, and where Arab regimes and non-state actors are becoming more clients than serious decision-makers; Third, the Iranian nuclear challenge, where every diplomatic maneuver and threat of economic sanctions or military strikes seems to bring closer, rather than delay or rule out, the specter of a regional nuclear arms race; Fourth, a developmental gap that has affected even the supposedly rich and stable monarchies of the region, that is when one is willing to look beyond the façade of fantastical projects; And finally, and most important in many ways, a freedom gap that has so far frustrated every attempt at peacemaking in the region, because the dividends of peace hold more promise for the peoples of the region than most of their ruling corrupt and authoritarian regimes. Until the US formulates a vision for its role in the region based on an objective assessment of realities on the ground, rather than the ideological ramblings of ""experts"" from the left and the right, and until it develops a real multi-track strategy that seeks to simultaneously address each of the challenges highlighted earlier, American involvement in the region will continue to be disastrous, no matter who is in charge in the White House.

The current article is part of a series advocating the revamping of US foreign policy in the region. He wrote this commentary for THE DAILY STAR. 83 of 266 DOCUMENTS The Guardian - Final Edition December 31, 2010 Friday Comment: Staring into the abyss: If Hezbollah is implicated in the death of Rafik Hariri, the consequences for Lebanon are dire Once again, Lebanon is on the brink. Rumours of an impending armed clash between Hezbollah and the pro-western governing coalition have spread like wildfire among the Lebanese people, who are hoarding food and arms in anticipation of the worst. On the surface, the crisis revolves around a United Nations tribunal set up to investigate the 2005 assassination of prime minister Rafik Hariri. An indictment is imminent; there is evidence that the tribunal will accuse members of Hezbollah, the Shia-dominated resistance movement, of having played a central role. This could provide the spark that ignites the next confrontation. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, has dismissed the tribunal as an ""American-Israeli"" tool intended to incite sectarian strife. He has demanded that the government - led by Saad Hariri, the son of the late PM - renounce it. On a deeper level, the standoff reflects a broader institutional crisis. Lebanon's institutions - the presidency, the cabinet and the parliament - have failed dismally to mediate conflict among rival groups, or to integrate rising social forces into the political process. Consequently, all eyes are now on Saudi Arabia and Syria, the two regional patrons of the rival Lebanese camps. They have attempted for months now to broker a settlement (with little success) that nullifies the tribunal and thus averts bloodshed. On the other hand, the US has reportedly impressed on its allies the need to support the tribunal. Sadly, Lebanon's leaders have resigned themselves to the belief that the resolution of the problem lies in the Saudi-Syrian initiative. Institutionally, Lebanon is a failed state. The political class has systemically used identity-politics to advance its material interests; in moments of duress it has called on foreign powers to sustain its dominance. Far from being sectarian-based or driven, the power struggle in Lebanon is multi-layered and complex. Sectarianism is used to mask vested interests. For a start, the political class is divided along two camps: Lebanon-first v Arab-Islamic. The Lebanon-first constituency advocates a pro-western foreign policy and neutrality in the Arab-Israeli conflict; the Arab-Islamic constituency supports the Iranian-Syrian front and resistance against Israel. The power struggle also conceals Lebanon's changing demographics: while Maronites and Sunnis control executive power, the rising Shia community feels marginalised. Moreover, Lebanon is a battleground for a fierce confrontation between the US and its regional allies, on the one hand, and Iran-Syria on the other. In a way, the fight over the tribunal is an extension of US-Iranian rivalry. Hezbollah fears the tribunal is a tool of US policy, designed to destroy the resistance against Israel. Obama hopes that the indictment of Hezbollah will damage its standing throughout the region. What US officials neglect is the effects of such an indictment on peace in Lebanon. Regardless of the evidence, the tribunal's decision will pour gasoline on a raging fire: Hezbollah's cohorts will view it as a conspiracy; Hariri's supporters, as evidence of Iranian-Syrian guilt. This will not be the first crisis, or the last. The country's dilemma is structural; as long as Lebanon's political class substitutes identity-politics for formal institutions, it will continue to be unstable. As long as Lebanon's leaders rely on foreign intervention to tip the internal balance of power in their favour, they will remain passive bystanders in determining their country's future.

84,Right Vision News,2010-04-15,Lebanon: US confirms Syria is arming Hezbollah,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"April 14, 2010",,"GAZA, April 15 -- US officials have confirmed Tel Aviv's reports of Syria supplying Hezbollah with missiles. Israeli President Shimon Peres on Tuesday accused Damascus of secretly providing Hezbollah with Scud missiles while publicly pushing for peace. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak also said that that his country is monitoring Hezbollah's weaponry. According to our correspondent, ""US officials briefed on the intelligence told the Wall Street Journal that they believe Syria transferred Scud missiles built with either North Korean or Russian technology to Hezbollah."" The Wall Street Journal added that senior Republican politicians intend to push the US Congress to obstruct plans of reappointing an ambassador in Damascus. US diplomat Robert Ford was appointed by President Barack Obama last January to return as Syria's US ambassador following a four-year absence. However, the media said that the aforementioned reports on arming Hezbollah made Obama ""reconsider his policy of reconciliation [with Damascus]."" Ford's nomination was approved by the House of Representatives' Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday. ""A full floor vote may be delayed until the administration can provide answers to the Israeli allegations,"" the Washington Post quoted congressional aides as saying.

85,BBC Monitoring Europe - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-09-07,"Turkish asks ""where is Middle East peace process headed""",,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"September 7, 2010",,"Text of report by Turkish newspaper Sabah website on 6 September [Column by Omer Taspinar: ""Where is the Middle East Peace Process Headed?""] What has come out of the Israeli-Palestinian talks, which after a two-year hiatus resumed this week under the auspices of [US President Barack] Obama? The answer of those who have no hopes from this process is simple: a great big zero. The ""front of the hopeless"" see this forced summit as wasting time. According to them, as long as interlocutors like Hamas and Syria are not at the table, peace with only Egypt, Jordan, and Al-Fatah is impossible. But for those who see the glass as half-full, the situation is different. They find the mere fact that such a negotiations process has begun to be encouraging. I say ""process"" because the two sides have decided to talk again in Egypt in late September. Moreover, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will take part in this meeting in Egypt. In other words, Washington does not want to let go of the rope. These talks are important to the US administration for two reasons. The first of these is the mid-term Congressional elections that are approaching in November. In other words, Obama's own political calendar. There is a high risk of the Democrats' losing the Congress in these elections. For the Obama administration, which appears unsuccessful both on the economy and in foreign policy, the fact that the Middle East Peace Process has started once again, even if only cosmetically, will be counted as a success. But from Washington's standpoint, the really important factor is that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu extend the promise he made not to build any new settlements, which will expire on 26 September. If this moratorium is not extended, Palestine Administration President Mahmud Abbas will depart the table. For this reason, it was very important that the negotiations begin prior to 26 September. If the moratorium is not extended, then the second round of Israeli-Palestinian talks, planned to be held on 14 September in Sharm al-Shaykh, in Egypt, will be dashed. The general expectation is to the effect that a ""watered down"" moratorium that does not cover East Jerusalem will continue. According to this calculation being made by Obama, the negotiations process will continue for another year, and thanks to this process, compromise will be sought on complex issues such as borders for two states, new settlements, refugees, security, and the status of Al-Quds [Jerusalem]. Well, is this plan of the US administration realistic? Clearly, not very. As I have repeatedly pointed out, all the problems in the Middle East are related to one another. It is not realistic to abstract the Israel-Palestine process from the Syria, Lebanon, and Iran issues. And also contained within the matter are Hezbollah, and the Hamas administration in Gaza, which are even harder to control. If a place is not opened in the Israeli-Palestinian talks to a Palestine administration that includes some moderate Hamas representatives, then HAMAs and Syria, on the one hand, and Hezbollah and Iran, on the other hand, will certainly sabotage this process. Indeed, the most recent attacks carried out by Hamas, and the repressive measures by the Israeli settlers in the West Bank, have already begun to sabotage the process. For all of these reasons, a summit on the Israel-Palestine issue in which everyone will be at the table, and a Middle East Peace Process in the real sense, are needed. The ""Oslo Peace Process"" that began in the 1990s following the Madrid Summit was, in this sense, a broader-scale diplomatic initiative. Turkey, under normal conditions, as a country that has good ties with Israel and whose prestige is rising in the Arab world, could work to convince the United States and Israel to host a summit in Istanbul like the Madrid Summit. But we are not under normal conditions. We are on the one hand suffering the most serious crisis of our history with Israel, and on the other hand are a ""party"" in the eyes of the United States due to our vote in favour of Iran in the UN. But until two [years] ago, we had taken on a very successful role of mediating between Syria and Israel. Under these conditions, the only possible way for Turkey to return to a serious role of mediation in the Middle East depends on its relations with Israel getting back on track. For a government and an opposition in an election period, this issue is as a matter of course quite sensitive. But despite everything, the UN investigation report could create an opportunity for a way out of the crisis for Ankara and Tel Aviv. We will wait and see what happens.

86,Turkish Government News,2010-07-06,Article by H.E. Ahmet Davutoglu published in Foreign Policy magazine (USA) on 20 May 2010,,753,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"January 8, 2010",1123 words,"The Ministry Of Foreign Affairs has issued following Mr.H.E. Ahmet Davutoglu (Minister of Foreign Affairs) Article: The Turkish government this week brokered an 11th-hour nuclear fuel swap deal with Iran. Turkey's foreign minister explains the principles that made it possible. (BY AHMET DAVUTOGLU ) Throughout modern history, there has been a direct relationship between conflict and the emergence of new ways of arbitrating world affairs. Every major war since the 17th century was concluded by a treaty that led to the emergence of a new order, from the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 that followed the Thirty Years' War, to the Congress of Vienna of 1814-1815 that brought an end to the Napoleonic Wars, to the ill-fated Treaty of Versailles that concluded the first World War, to the agreement at Yalta that laid the groundwork for the establishment of the United Nations in 1945. Yet the Cold War, which could be regarded as a global-scale war, ended not with grand summitry, but with the fall of the Iron Curtain and the collapse of the Soviet Union. There was no official conclusion; one of the combatant sides just suddenly ceased to exist. Two decades hence, no new international legal and political system has been formally created to meet the challenges of the new world order that emerged. Instead, a number of temporary, tactical, and conflict-specific agreements have been implemented. From the Nagorno-Karabakh region to Cyprus, and even the deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian dispute, a series of cease-fire arrangements have succeeded in ending bloodshed but have failed to establish comprehensive peace agreements. Overall, the current situation has quantitatively increased the diversification of international actors and qualitatively complicated the foreign-policy making process. The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks made it clear that this situation is not sustainable. Immediately after the attacks, the United States began attempting to establish an international order based on a security discourse, thus replacing the liberty discourse that emerged after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. It is in this context that the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq can best be understood. The intent was to transform an unstable international environment by targeting crisis-prone zones that were considered to be the sources of insecurity. But in the process, predictions about the end of history and the expansion of civil rights and liberties have largely lost their appeal. U.S. President Barack Obama challenged the security-based perspective of the post-Sept. 11 era as soon as he assumed the presidency in 2009. He has actively attempted to restore America's international image, and has made considerable efforts to adopt a new vision that embraces a multilateral international system and fosters close cooperation with regional allies. Still, we are faced with an incredibly difficult period until a new global order is established. Many of today's challenges can only be resolved with broader international involvement, but the mechanisms needed to meet fully those challenges do not exist. It will therefore fall largely to nation-states to meet and create solutions for the global political, cultural, and economic turmoil that will likely last for the next decade and beyond. In this new world, Turkey is playing an increasingly central role in promoting international security and prosperity. The new dynamics of Turkish foreign policy ensure that Turkey can act with the vision, determination, and confidence that the historical moment demands. Turkey in the post-Cold War era Turkey experienced the direct impact of the post-Cold War atmosphere of insecurity, which resulted in a variety of security problems in Turkey's neighborhood. The most urgent issue for Turkish diplomacy, in this context, was to harmonize Turkey's influential power axes with the new international environment. During the Cold War, Turkey was a ""wing country"" under NATO's strategic framework, resting on the geographic perimeter of the Western alliance. NATO's strategic concept, however, has evolved in the post-Cold War era -- and so has Turkey's calculation of its strategic environment. Turkey's presence in Afghanistan is a clear indication of this change. We are a wing country no longer. Turkey is currently facing pressure to assume an important regional role, which admittedly has created tensions between its existing strategic alliances and its emerging regional responsibilities. The challenge of managing these relationships was acutely felt in recent regional crises in the Caucasus, the Balkans, and the Middle East. Turkey remains committed to establishing harmony between its current strategic alliances and its neighbors and neighboring regions. Turkey's unique demographic realities also affect its foreign-policy vision. There are more Bosnians in Turkey than in Bosnia-Herzegovina, more Albanians than in Kosovo, more Chechens than in Chechnya, more Abkhazians than in the Abkhaz region in Georgia, and a significant number of Azeris and Georgians, in addition to considerable other ethnicities from neighboring regions. Thus, these conflicts and the effect they have on their populations have a direct impact on domestic politics in Turkey. Because of this fact, Turkey experiences regional tensions at home and faces public demands to pursue an active foreign-policy to secure the peace and security of those communities. In this sense, Turkish foreign policy is also shaped by its own democracy, reflecting the priorities and concerns of its citizens. As a result of globalization, the Turkish public follows international developments closely. Turkey's democratization requires it to integrate societal demands into its foreign policy, just as all mature democracies do. The European Union and NATO are the main fixtures and the main elements of continuity in Turkish foreign policy. Turkey has achieved more within these alliances during the past seven years under the AK Party government than it did in the previous 40 years. Turkey's involvement in NATO has increased during this time; Turkey recently asked for, and achieved, a higher representation in the alliance. Turkey also has advanced considerably in the European integration process compared with the previous decade, when it was not even clear whether the EU was seriously considering Turkey's candidacy. EU progress reports state that Turkish foreign policy and EU objectives are in harmony, a clear indication that Turkey's foreign-policy orientation aligns well with transatlantic objectives. As we leave behind the first decade of the 21st century, Turkey has been able to formulate a foreign-policy vision based on a better understanding of the realities of the new century, even as it acts in accordance with its historical role and geographical position. In this sense, Turkey's orientation and strategic alliance with the West remains perfectly compatible with Turkey's involvement in, among others, Iraq, Iran, the Caucasus, the Middle East peace process, and Afghanistan. Our principles Over the past seven years, Turkey has been able to formulate a systematic and cohesive methodological approach to world affairs because its political party has been able to govern, resulting in real political stability at home. Three methodological and five operational principles drive Turkey's foreign policy today. The first methodological principle is its ""visionary"" approach to the issues instead of the ""crisis-oriented"" attitude that dominated foreign policy during the entire Cold War period. For example, Turkey has a vision of the Middle East. This vision encompasses the entire region: It cannot be reduced to the struggle against the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party), the radical Kurdish separatist group that for decades has waged a campaign of terror against Turkey, or efforts to counterbalance specific countries. Turkey can use its unique understanding of the Middle East, and its diplomatic assets, to operate effectively on the ground. Turkey's Lebanon policy, its attempts to mediate between Syria and Israel and achieve Palestinian reconciliation, its efforts to facilitate the participation of Iraqi Sunni groups in the 2005 parliamentary elections, and its constructive involvement in the Iranian nuclear issue are integral parts of Turkey's foreign-policy vision for the Middle East. The second methodological principle is to base Turkish foreign policy on a ""consistent and systematic"" framework around the world. Turkey's vision for the Middle East is not in opposition to its approach in Central Asia or in the Balkans; our approach to Africa is no different from our approach to Asia. Turkey is also actively trying to improve relations with nearby countries like Greece, Iraq, the Russian Federation, and Syria. The third methodological principle is the adoption of a new discourse and diplomatic style, which has resulted in the spread of Turkish soft power in the region. Although Turkey maintains a powerful military due to its insecure neighborhood, we do not make threats. Instead, Turkish diplomats and politicians have adopted a new language in regional and international politics that prioritizes Turkey's civil-economic power. From these three methodological approaches, five operational principles guide Turkey's foreign policy-making process. The first principle is the balance between security and democracy. The legitimacy of any political regime comes from its ability to provide security and freedom together to its citizens; this security should not be at the expense of freedoms and human rights in the country. Since 2002, Turkey has attempted to promote civil liberties without undermining security. This is an ambitious yet worthy aim -- particularly in the post-Sept. 11 environment, under the threat of terrorism, in which the general tendency has been to restrict liberties for the sake of security. Turkey has made great strides in protecting civil liberties despite serious domestic political challenges to such freedoms over the past seven years. This required vigorously carrying out the struggle against terrorism without narrowing the sphere of civil liberties -- a challenge Turkey successfully overcame. In the process, we've found that Turkish soft power has only increased as our democracy has matured. Second, the principle of zero problems towards neighbors has been successfully implemented for the past seven years. Turkey's relations with its neighbors now follow a more cooperative track. There is a developing economic interdependence between Turkey and its neighboring countries. In 2009, for example, we achieved considerable diplomatic progress with Armenia, which nevertheless remains the most problematic relationship in Turkey's neighborhood policy. Turkey's considerable achievements in its regional relationships have led policymakers to take this principle a step further and aim for maximum cooperation with our neighbors. Since the second half of 2009, Turkey established high-level strategic council meetings with Iraq, Syria, Greece and Russia. These are joint cabinet meetings where bilateral political, economic, and security issues are discussed in detail. There are also preparations to establish similar mechanisms with Bulgaria, Azerbaijan and Ukraine as well as other neighboring countries. Turkey abolished visa requirements with, among others, Syria, Tajikistan, Albania, Lebanon, Jordan, Libya and Russia. Turkey's trade with its neighbors and nearby regions has substantially increased in recent years. The third operative principle is proactive and pre-emptive peace diplomacy, which aims to take measures before crises emerge and escalate to a critical level. Turkey's regional policy is based on security for all, high-level political dialogue, economic integration and interdependence, and multicultural coexistence. Consider Turkey's mediation between Israel and Syria, a role that was not assigned to Turkey by any outside actor. Other examples of pre-emptive diplomacy include Turkey's efforts to achieve Sunni-Shiite reconciliation in Iraq, reconciliation efforts in Lebanon and Palestine, the Serbia-Bosnia reconciliation in the Balkans, dialogue between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the reconstruction of Darfur and Somalia. The fourth principle is adherence to a multi-dimensional foreign policy. Turkey's relations with other global actors aim to be complementary, not in competition. Such a policy views Turkey's strategic relationship with the United States through the two countries' bilateral strategic ties and through NATO. It considers its EU membership process, its good neighborhood policy with Russia, and its synchronization policy in Eurasia as integral parts of a consistent policy that serves to complement each other. This means that good relations with Russia are not an alternative to relations with the EU. Nor is the model partnership with the United States a rival partnership against Russia. The fifth principle in this framework is rhythmic diplomacy, which aspires to provide Turkey with a more active role in international relations. This principle implies active involvement in all international organizations and on all issues of global and international importance. Turkey became a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and is chairing three critical commissions concerning Afghanistan, North Korea, and the fight against terror. Turkey undertook the chairmanship-in-office of the South-East European Cooperation Process, a forum for dialogue among Balkan states and their immediate neighbors, for 2009 and 2010. Turkey is also a member of G-20, maintains observer status in the African Union, has a strategic dialogue mechanism with the Gulf Cooperation Council, and actively participates in the Arab League. Turkey has also launched new diplomatic initiatives by opening 15 new embassies in Africa and two in Latin America, and is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol. These developments show a new perspective of Turkey, one that is based on vision, soft power, a universal language, and implementation of consistent foreign policies in different parts of the world. A new vision Today, Turkey has a great deal of say in the international arena. More importantly, there is a critical group of countries that lends a careful ear to Turkey's stance on a myriad of regional and international issues. At this point, the world expects great things from Turkey, and we are fully aware of our responsibility to carry out a careful foreign policy. Our ""2023 vision,"" to mark the Turkish Republic's centennial, is a result of this necessity. The first step of this vision is to integrate Turkey's foreign-policy discourse into its national discourse. Any possible contradiction, gap or contrast between these two will make it difficult to carry out an active, responsible, and successful foreign policy. In the coming era, Turkey plans to deepen and strengthen its democracy, place relations between Turkish society and Turkey's governing institutions on firm ground, and show the world the strength of its own domestic balance. There is a continuous need to integrate domestic political accomplishments into the vision of foreign policy (i.e. democratization and cultural respect) and to inject foreign-policy activism and self-confidence back into the domestic political scene. Thanks to the multi-dimensional and dynamic nature of Turkish foreign policy, Turkey's relations with the US are being built on firmer ground. Turkish-U.S. relations have reached a point where they can ensure bilateral cooperation and work toward global stability. Put into a framework of ""model partnership"" described by President Obama when he visited Turkey on his first overseas trip, bilateral relations are of vital importance for both countries. The term ""model partnership"" emphasizes the importance of high-level cooperation between Turkey, with its multiple regional identities and an increasing say in global affairs, and the United States, which has long-lasting ties with regional countries and direct responsibility for global stability. The partnership is guided by a set of shared values and principles aimed at bringing peace, security, stability, and economic prosperity to the zones of conflict in various regions. Meanwhile, relations with the EU are also being bolstered. It is no longer possible to think of the EU and Turkey independent of one another when considering Turkey's foreign policy. EU integration is undoubtedly a process that is favorable to Turkey. But this process brings great benefits to the EU itself, both regionally and globally. Turkey's foreign-policy objectives and its vision of how to achieve them are very clear. Turkey has multiple goals over the next decade: First, it aims to achieve all EU membership conditions and become an influential EU member state by 2023. Second, it will continue to strive for regional integration, in the form of security and economic cooperation. Third, it will seek to play an influential role in regional conflict resolution. Fourth, it will vigorously participate in all global arenas. Fifth, it will play a determining role in international organizations and become one of the top 10 largest economies in the world. These goals aim to build a strong and respectable Turkey that is able to make an original contribution to the world community. To achieve them, Turkey must make progress in all directions and in every field, take an interest in every issue related to global stability, and contribute accordingly. This collective effort will make Turkey a global actor in this century. Turkey's actions are motivated by a great sense of responsibility, entrusted to it by its rich historical and geographic heritage, and by a profound consciousness of the importance of global stability and peace.

Excerpt from report on parliamentary proceedings published by Iranian newspaper Mardom Salari on 7 January According to ILNA [Iran Labour News Agency], Parviz Soruri, the MP for Tehran and a member of the special parliamentary committee set up to investigate the condition of detainees who were held in detention centres in the wake of the post-election unrest, speaking to parliamentary reporters, disclosed that the committee had presented a report on its findings to the Majlis speaker on Wednesday [6 January], and said: This report was prepared with the consensus of the committee members, and I think that when the report is published it will become clear that it is a comprehensive and realistic report. [Passage omitted on statement that some individuals had been identified by name in the report, but the committee was not in a position to pass judgment on them.] As to whether other matters would be referred to the aforementioned committee, Parviz Soruri said that it was up to the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee to make such a decision, and said: The committee has carried out its duties, and if it is felt that it ought to look into other issues the committee is prepared to carry out such a task as well. According to ISNA [Iran Students News Agency], Ali Akbar Oliya, the MP for Yazd and a member of the minority faction in parliament, speaking in the course of a mid-agenda speech during yesterday's open session of the Majlis, said: I express my opposition to the arrest, detention and treatment of a number of academic figures and executive officials, some of whom had served the late Imam [Khomeyni] with loyalty, as well as the attack carried out on the mosque at Jamaran. I consider such acts to be at variance with the [Supreme Leader's] strategy of absorbing and including the maximum number of people and excluding the minimum number of people [from the political system]. [Passage omitted on statement that political differences must not be allowed to create a rift in society.] The MP for Yazd went on to say: Let us bear in mind that the intermittent presence of security forces in the streets of our country's capital city is not a positive development because this development would only divert resources away from the main issues and concerns of all of us, which involve important economic issues facing our country. According to ISNA, Dr Mahmud al-Abrash, the speaker of the Syrian parliament, who addressed the Majlis in the course of yesterday's open session of parliament at the invitation of Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani, said: The Syrian nation will stand shoulder-to-shoulder alongside the Islamic Revolution of Iran with all its strength, and we consider the Islamic Revolution as a model for the Muslim nations in to region to follow. [Passage omitted on statement that the enemies of Islam would be defeated in the face of the steadfastness of Muslim nations.] The speaker of Syria's parliament went on to say: Iran and Syria are cooperating with each other on a variety of issues, and we are always alongside Iran and we endorse the Islamic Republic of Iran's legitimate right to utilize nuclear energy. According to ISNA, following a debate on the budget law of 1388 [year beginning 21 March 2009], lawmakers approved and passed an amendment under clause 7 of the aforementioned law which would allow the Ministry of Oil to authorize state corporations affiliated to the ministry to raise the price of natural gas by 20 rials per cubic metre and to use the proceeds from the additional revenues to improve the provision of gas supplies in villages and rural settlements in the country. Majid Nasirpur, the MP for Sarab and a member of the Majlis Social Committee, speaking to the correspondent of Khaneh-e Mellat [Nation's House], disclosed that the aforementioned committee had approved a plan to conduct an inquiry into the performance of the Social Security Organization and the State Pensions Organization, and said: In view of the concerns expressed over the financial crisis facing the Social Security Organization and the State Pensions Organization, the members of the Majlis Social Committee voted in favour of conducting an inquiry into the performance of these organizations. Majid Nasirpur went on to say: The aim of the inquiry is to address the concerns felt over the biggest social challenge in the last decade facing the Social Security Organization and all its affiliated institutions, as well as the State Pensions Organization and all its affiliated agencies. According to ILNA, following a series of incidents involving disrespect shown to a number of parliamentarians, Mohammad Reza Tabesh, the general-secretary of the parliamentary faction which follows the line of the late Imam [Khomeyni] in the Majlis, in a letter addressed to Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani, invoked the provisions of Article 23, sub-section 11, of the Majlis by-laws to call on the parliamentary speaker to take appropriate steps for safeguarding the dignity of lawmakers and prosecuting those elements who had been responsible for resorting to such undignified acts towards members of parliament. In the course of yesterday's open session of the Majlis, Mostafa Kavakebian, the MP for Semnan and a member of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, tabled a written motion calling on the minister of economic affairs and finance to explain the reason for rejecting the eligibility of rival corporations in terms of the public offering of shares of the Telecommunications Company of Iran on the Tehran stock exchange. In a separate written motion, the MP for Semnan called on the foreign minister, Manuchehr Mottaki, to take appropriate action against the government of Saudi Arabia for its disrespectful conduct towards Ayatollah Sistani. According to ILNA, Nader Qazipur, the MP for Orumieh, speaking in the course of yesterday's open session of parliament, invoked the provisions of Article 23 of the Majlis by-laws to criticise the Ministry of Education's failure to recruit teachers on a contractual basis in contravention of a resolution adopted by the Majlis, and said: In accordance with a resolution adopted by the Majlis, the Ministry of Education was required to take steps to recruit 10,000 teachers on a contractual basis but, unfortunately, no such steps have been taken so far. Nader Qazipur went on to say: Recently, the education minister announced in an interview that he was not going to recruit the aforementioned teachers. I do not know what it is about that ministerial chair, because whoever happens to sit on it refuses to carry out the pledges and undertakings which have been given on this matter!

88,The Daily Star (Lebanon),2010-12-18,Iraq says Lebanon indictment to be delayed,,23,Newspaper,, DAVID SCHENKER,ENGLISH,NEWS; Pg. 6,"February 25, 2011",1703 words,"The reported postponement of the indictment is apparently linked to a new approach in US policy aimed to defuse political tensions with Iran and other hot spots, including Lebanon, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said. Zebari spelled out the new US approach following his meeting in New York with Vice President Joe Biden. Zebari attended a UN Security Council meeting Wednesday that ended key international sanctions imposed on Iraq during the Saddam Hussein era over weapons of mass destruction. Asked to comment on America's policy toward Iran, Zebari said in an interview with the pan-Arab newspaper Al-Hayat, ""It [US policy] is heading toward pacification, rather than an escalation or a complication of the situation and relations [with Iran]."" ""This is what I have sensed concerning [Iran's] nuclear issue and the tribunal,"" he said, referring to the UN-appointed Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL), which is prosecuting suspects in Hariri's assassination. ""There is currently a tendency toward postponing the release of the indictment due to requests, probably even Lebanese requests,"" Zebari said. However, Zebari noted that any postponement of the indictment would not be indefinite. ""Instead of [the indictment] being issued this month, it will probably be issued next month,"" he said. By virtue of it being an ""important regional player,"" Zebari said Iraq was following up developments of the tribunal. ""We are also a party in this equation. We are not absent from US-Iranian relations, [Iran's] nuclear issue, the situation in Lebanon, the tribunal's decision or indictment and from relations with Syria,"" Zebari added. Zebari's remarks came more than a week after the STL's registrar Herman von Hebel told journalists at the court's headquarters in the Netherlands that the office of the tribunal's prosecutor Daniel Bellemare will send a draft indictment to the pre-trial judge for confirmation ""very, very soon."" The pre-trial judge Daniel Fransen could then take about six to 10 weeks to decide whether to confirm the indictment and issue arrest warrants, either under seal or by naming suspects publicly. The report about the looming indictment, which is widely expected to implicate Hizbullah members in Hariri's killing, has heightened political tension in the country. It came amid a Cabinet paralysis and a split between the March 8 and March 14 factions over the indictment and the controversial issue of ""false witnesses"" linked to the UN probe into Hariri's killing. The Cabinet failed during its meeting Wednesday to settle this issue, prompting President Michel Sleiman to defer the discussions when the ministers of the March 8 alliance demanded a vote on the issue that has crippled the government's work for more than a month. Hizbullah and its allies in the March 8 alliance have long insisted that the key to defusing political and sectarian tensions over the indictment lies in prosecuting the ""false witnesses."" They have demanded that the Cabinet act on this issue either by consensus or by a vote for referring it to the Judicial Council, the country's highest court. This demand was rejected by the March 14 factions, which fear that investigating ""false witnesses"" by the Judicial Council would eventually obstruct the STL's work. Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who chaired a meeting of his Future bloc, said that no one knows the exact date as to when the indictment will be released, LBCI TV reported. The meeting, held at Hariri's residence in Downtown Beirut, discussed the latest political developments in the country. For his part, the Maronite patriarch said Lebanon would eventually overcome the current crisis over the indictment. But in an interview with the weekly magazine Al-Massira, Cardinal Nasrallah Butros Sfeir warned that Hizbullah might carry out a coup to confront the repercussions of the indictment. ""But staging a coup is something and maintaining it is something else,"" he said. ""Lebanon is not a deserted arena or a country that no one cares about. This is not new in the history of this country, which has a diversity of sects and cultures,"" Sfeir added. Meanwhile, Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) leader Michel Aoun said that media leaks about the indictment seemed to be true. He said he believes that the indictment would be issued after Epiphany Day, or after January 6 when the holiday in Europe ends. In an interview with Russia Today TV, Aoun warned that initiatives currently undertaken to resolve the Lebanese crisis will end once the indictment is issued. Asked what will happen when an indictment is issued, Aoun said, Hizbullah's response would be ""as strong as the attack."" ""The response will be from the accused, who is innocent, against the accusing party,"" he said. He added that there would not be chaos after the release of the indictment. Asked to comment on the Saudi-Syrian efforts, Aoun said, ""Probably, these efforts are [designed] to stop or amend the indictment. I don't know."" Aoun blamed Hariri for the Cabinet paralysis, saying that the prime minister is abstaining from voting on the issue of ""false witnesses."" ""The government, represented by the [Parliament] majority, is responsible for this paralysis because it is abstaining from voting. Therefore, we hold the prime minister responsible for preventing the judiciary from doing what it is right,"" he said. Phalange Party leader Amin Gemayel warned that Lebanon was doomed to destruction if the tribunal did not reveal the truth behind the assassinations of Rafik Hariri, his son, Pierre, and other MPs and politicians in the March 14 coalition. ""We have full confidence in the tribunal, especially since the trial will be public,"" Gemayel said in an interview with the LBCI TV on the eve of the 75th anniversary of the Party's founding. ""We will not accept a politicized tribunal. For a thousand of reasons, we adhere to knowing the truth behind the assassinations,"" he said. Addressing his words to Hizbullah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who has dismissed the STL an ""American-Israeli"" tool to incite sectarian strife, Gemayel said: ""Sayyed Nasrallah's remarks are strange. He wants me to forget Pierre, or Saad Hariri to forget his father, [former] Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. We are only demanding justice."" UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon Michael Williams said that a solution to any crisis ""should be achieved through dialogue and through working through the country's state institutions,"" according to a statement issued by Williams' press office. Speaking after meeting with Zghorta MP Suleiman Franjieh in Bnashii in the north, Williams said the assertions by the various parties in Lebanon that they wanted to avoid conflict were reassuring. ""These [assertions] must be coupled with concrete steps and actions toward a solution and away from tension and distrust,"" he said. Williams said he hoped that the Saudi-Syrian efforts would eventually lead to a solution for the crisis over the indictment. Hizbullah's deputy leader Sheikh Naim Qassem said the STL's indictment was dead even before it is issued. ""Assuming that the indictment will be issued tomorrow, this will not change anything in the current situation because we have buried it before it has even been issued. Therefore, the indictment, in Hizbullah's view, is worthless,"" Qassem told a rally in Beirut's southern suburbs. Qassem, according to a statement released by Hizbullah's media office, said Hizbullah was not worried about the repercussions of the indictment. ""When we raise our voice [regarding the indictment], we do so for the sake of Lebanon,"" he added. Qassem advised rival factions to support the compromise being worked out by Syria and Saudi Arabia ""because we want the country's salvation."" 89 of 266 DOCUMENTS Jerusalem Post August 31, 2010 Tuesday Reassessing US military assistance to Lebanon. Without action by the US that recognizes the changes since Joe Biden announced that aid would be conditioned on the composition and the policies of the Lebanese government, any lingering benefits to Washington will disappear Given competing interests at stake with Washington's $100 million annual military assistance to Beirut, clear benchmarks should be established to track the relationship between the Lebanese Armed Forces and Hizbullah and limit the potential for nostalgia or sentimentality to cloud American policy-making. Since 2005, the US has obligated itself to provide more than $700m. in military assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces. In the aftermath of the LAF's August 3 cross-border shooting of two Israeli officers, one fatal, this funding has come under increasing scrutiny. Not coincidentally, the shooting followed a series of setbacks for Washington's allies in Beirut, which in turn fundamentally altered the conditions that had spurred the 2005 spike in US funding. It is unclear how this new dynamic is affecting the military, but many infer from the shooting that the LAF is shifting away from neutrality and toward Hizbullah. More broadly, the incident has resurrected questions as to whether Washington's main policy objective for the LAF - establishing state sovereignty throughout Lebanese territory - is achievable. Despite these profound changes on the ground, US policy toward Lebanon - with LAF funding as its cornerstone - remains unchanged. On August 12, State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner went so far as to describe the funding as part of America's ""vital... national interests."" During the heyday of the Cedar Revolution, this level of prioritization may have been warranted, but does it remain so today? Background In 2005, the Bush administration boosted previously minute levels of US assistance to the LAF in response to the Cedar Revolution, which ended Syria's 30-year occupation of Lebanon. Although Hizbullah still dominated the south and much of Beirut, Washington saw Syria's departure as an unprecedented opportunity to foster full Lebanese government control over the entire country. Currently, however, Damascus has reestablished itself as a force in Beirut, and Hizbullah is again ascendant. Recognizing these changes, Rep. Howard Berman (D-California), chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, placed a hold on the 2011 assistance package on August 2, requesting that the administration clarify the provision. The move turned out to be prescient, with LAF troops opening fire on Israeli troops the next day. Mixed record Washington's revitalized Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program for Lebanon had two goals. In the long term, the objective was to build sufficient capacity in the LAF in order to counteract militias and enhance state sovereignty. (The Bush administration did not believe the LAF would be able to supplant Hizbullah anytime soon). In the near term, US funding would enhance the LAF's counterterrorism capabilities against al-Qaida affiliates, a critical need given the lack of state control throughout much of the country. The program hit a high note early on when, following the 2006 Hizbullah-Israel war, the LAF made an unprecedented deployment to the south. Not only was it the first time in decades that the military had based troops near the border with Israel, it also constituted the first significant government presence in that Hizbullah-controlled territory. Counterterror cooperation has been a positive as well - according to Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman, US assistance has led to ""significant"" improvements in LAF operations along those lines. But there have also been disappointments. During the 2006 war, for example, LAF elements colluded with Hizbullah, allowing the group to use Lebanese navy radar to track and nearly sink the Israel Navy Corvette Hanit. Likewise, in 2008, the LAF coordinated with Hizbullah during the militia's foray into Beirut, offering no challenge to the offensive and later relieving the militiamen and taking up the group's positions following withdrawal. The deployment to the south has been problematic as well. At the time, few expected the LAF to fully implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701 by interdicting Hizbullah weapons. Yet aside from LAF troops being present in the area, the operation has proven mostly cosmetic. Worse, if Israeli claims are true, the LAF has been tipping Hizbullah off about UN Interim Force in Lebanon site visits, protecting the militia's assets and undermining UNIFIL's mission. Purpose of FMF programs In general, Foreign Military Financing programs are designed to accomplish three goals: build the military capabilities of friendly states; help Washington understand and gain influence with these militaries; and deter meddling by unfriendly states. Notwithstanding Hizbullah's growing political role, Washington continues to count Lebanon among the friendly states, and US military officers have gained important insight into the LAF's thinking via the assistance program. Yet progress on the other objectives has been slow to come. First, it is difficult to determine how much influence Washington has cultivated with the LAF since 2005. Beirut's response to the August 3 incident was not reassuring. For example, President Michel Suleiman, former LAF chief of staff, applauded the shooting as a ""heroic"" act and pledged that Lebanon would seek ""more advanced equipment"" from ""friendly"" countries. A statement by Defense Minister Elias Murr after the US congressional freeze was equally hostile: ""Let them keep their money or give it to Israel."" LAF chief of staff Gen. Jean Kahwaji likewise dismissed reports of the freeze as ""only ideas suggested by some US Congress members who are [influenced by the] pro-Israeli lobby."" Moreover, the $100m. in US FMF slated for 2010 may not prevent Lebanon from accepting Iranian or Russian military assistance. Iran has long offered to provide such support, and in 2008, Murr accepted a (yet-to-be-delivered) donation of 10 MiG-29 fighter planes from Moscow. Although refusing such gifts would no doubt cause grave embarrassment for Beirut, the LAF is not particularly enthusiastic about them. Its personnel have long been working to standardize on American equipment, and materiel from elsewhere tends to interfere with those efforts. Moreover, the military is well aware that Iranian assistance typically comes with long strings attached. Keeping Score Five years after the Cedar Revolution, the last main vestige of Washington's commitment to its Lebanese allies is the FMF program. When Vice President Joe Biden visited Beirut in May 2009, on the eve of Lebanese general elections, he announced that Washington would ""evaluate the shape of our assistance program based on the composition of the new government and the policies it advocates."" Today, the March 14 movement sits in a coalition government with Hizbullah, and its guiding ""ministerial statement"" now legitimizes the ""resistance"" and its weapons. In the past, these developments may have meant an end to US assistance, but with few other avenues of meaningful engagement, the program has persisted. To be sure, there is merit in Washington's desire to avoid abandoning its allies, which some might view as a repeat of the 1983 US ""redeployment"" out of Lebanon. But it is also clear that the bar defined by the American vice president has been lowered considerably over the past 15 months. Without some action by the United States that recognizes the profoundly changed circumstances since Biden announced that aid would effectively be conditioned on the composition and the policies of the Lebanese government, any lingering benefits Washington reaps from maintaining the FMF program will disappear. One way to remedy the situation is for the State Department and congressional appropriators to work out clear, transparent, measurable and verifiable benchmarks by which all sides - including the Lebanese - can evaluate the merit of maintaining assistance to the LAF. The key metric is the relationship between the LAF and Hizbullah. While some connection between elements of the two institutions is to be expected, especially given the Shi'ite plurality within the LAF, several indicators would provide useful insight into the depth of the relationship. Specifically, going forward, the FMF program should be contingent on a close assessment that measures, among other things: ¥ LAF response to officers who share intelligence with Hizbullah, ""go rogue,"" or demonstrate other problematic conduct with regard to the group (e.g., are they disciplined or congratulated?) ¥ LAF's role in harboring or otherwise protecting Hizbullah weaponry (e.g., does the LAF play a role in preventing the import of weapons from Syria or their flow south of the Litani or in facilitating it?) ¥ Flow of personnel between Hizbullah and the LAF (e.g., do officials of Hizbullah's militia transfer directly into the LAF?) ¥ Flow of weapons and other material between the LAF and Hizbullah (e.g., does LAF weaponry end up under Hizbullah control?) ¥ Quality of LAF cooperation with UNIFIL (e.g., do LAF units seem to follow Hizbullah guidance in obstructing the operations of UNIFIL?) ¥ LAF response to the anticipated indictment of Hizbullah members by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, currently probing the assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri (e.g., will the LAF arrest and transfer indicted Hizbullah officials or refuse to implement the tribunal's request?). Conclusion Although $100m. per year is minimal by US FMF standards, it constitutes a significant portion of the LAF budget and carries great symbolism. In August 2007, Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feltman - then ambassador to Lebanon - gave a speech at LAF headquarters, marking the delivery of 100 Humvees: ""Through our military assistance, the people and government of the United States, including members of Congress, show our confidence in Lebanon's government, Lebanon's Ministry of Defense, and in the leadership and soldiers of the LAF,"" he stated. Absent that kind of confidence, which clear and transparent measurements can provide, Washington's military assistance program with Lebanon has a bleak future.

90,Jerusalem Post,2010-12-27,Ankara's clear signals,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"February 22, 2011",834 words,"Ankara will accept nothing short of a public apology and full financial compensation for the Mavi Marmara raid as a condition for improving diplomatic relations with Jerusalem. That was the message sent out over the weekend by Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. ""No friendship of whatever kind can overshadow the fact that Turkish citizens have been killed,"" Davutoglu noted, and went on to blame ""conflicting signals"" from Jerusalem for the current diplomatic chill between the countries. The foreign minister's allegations, fiercely and undiplomatically contested on Sunday by his counterpart Avigdor Lieberman, are disingenuous. If Turkey truly wished to resolve the ongoing tension between the countries over the Mavi Marmara, it could do so in an atmosphere of mutual respect, sensitivity and trust. Instead, Ankara has insisted that Israel issue a humiliating apology and provide compensation in a way that might expose IDF soldiers to international legal action. Tellingly, there has been no Turkish recognition of the brutal violence perpetrated by so-called ""peace activists"" on board the Gaza-bound Mavi Marmara seven months ago. Ankara has not been willing to admit that the IDF soldiers who boarded the ship to enforce the naval blockade of Hamas-controlled Gaza, which has become a base for terrorist activities against Israel, killed the nine Turkish activists while defending themselves against iron bars and other potentially lethal instruments. The resolution demanded by Turkey does not conform to the kind of terms demanded by friendly nations. And for all of Israel's genuine desire to heal relations with what was hitherto a vital regional ally, meeting those terms would be self-defeating. Apparently, that is Ankara's intention. AHEAD OF national elections slated for 2011, Turkey's ruling Islamic party, the AKP, seems to have an interest in capitalizing on widespread anti-Israel sentiment among the more religious rural population which makes up a large portion of its constituency. Hurriyet, a secular daily critical of the AKP, has lamented this change in Turkish foreign policy, which has brought it increasingly into the political orbit of Iran and Syria and their proxies, Hamas and Hizbullah. It hasn't always been this way. After the AKP's rise to power in 2002, Turkey had initially sought to maintain the relatively good relations fostered with Israel in 1993 after the signing of the Oslo Accords. Turkey and Israel have common ground for cooperation. They are the region's only two democracies and have strong secular political frameworks. The two countries' defense forces were galvanized by a perception of shared military threats from the dominant Arab states surrounding them. Turkey even served as a mediator for indirect talks between Israel and Syria. But more recently, the change has been sharp. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan fostered ties with Hamas, whose leader Khaled Mashaal's visit to Ankara in February 2006 was the first significant blow to relations with Israel. In parallel, Turkey improved ties with Syria, as symbolized by the scrapping of the visa regime between the two countries in October 2009. At the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos in January 2009, Erdogan made a concerted effort to publicly distance his country from ours. He exploited an appearance together with President Shimon Peres at the gathering, which coincided with the end of Operation Cast Lead, to accuse Israel of ""barbaric attacks"" and responsibility for ""crimes against humanity"" in Gaza, storming off the stage in a theatric show of rancor. The Turkish government's quasi-sponsorship of the Gaza flotilla, and the fallout since the Mavi Marmara interception, merely mark an unfortunate confirmation of Ankara's ongoing policy of distancing from Israel while fostering closer ties with Iran and Syria. A beam of light was Turkey's alacrity this month in sending firefighting planes to help fight the Carmel blazes. But that beam was dimmed, first when Erdogan made it bluntly clear that this aid should not be misconstrued as a sign of Turkish recalibration on the Mavi Marmara affair, and again this weekend when Davutoglu risibly claimed that Israel would not have done the same for Turkey. It is no wonder that high-ranking Israeli and Turkish officials who met recently in Geneva failed to reach a reconciliatory agreement. Finding an equitable resolution to the Mavi Marmara incident would not be beyond the skills of senior diplomats from our two countries, but it would necessitate genuine mutual goodwill. Sadly, Turkey's entire approach to the affair - itself an extension of its policy of solidarity with a Hamas government that came to power through violence and rules Gaza through fear - bespeaks anything but goodwill. Contrary to what Davutoglu would have us believe, the failure to resolve diplomatic tensions has nothing to do with ""conflicting signals"" coming out of Jerusalem and everything to do with the clear and grim signals emanating from Ankara."
91,The Business Times Singapore,2010-07-10,A new storyline in the old Middle-East saga; Evolving values of a new empowered Turkish majority are creating the foundations for a more independent foreign policy that is neither 'pro' or 'anti' American,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"July 9, 2010",1143  words,"SOME American commentators have a new story to tell about the Middle Eastern region. Turkey, they claim, under the leadership of the Islamist Justice and Development Party (AKP), has been setting aside the secular and pro-Western orientation of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, and is being transformed into a member of a new anti-American and anti-Israeli Axis of Evil. So, Turkey is now a member of an Islamofascist alliance that includes Iran and Syria and their partners (Hamas and Hizbollah). Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his aides are supposedly pursuing a Neo-Ottoman strategy based on establishing close ties with the Arab World and de-legitimising the Jewish State. The policy implication of such an account is that the US and Israel have therefore no other choice but to regard Turkey - not unlike Iran - as an assertive strategic and ideological power posing direct threat to Western interests and the survival of Israel. All this is quite different from the other narrative we have been exposed to until recently. The old narrative suggested that Turkey was led by a democratic Islamist political party and that the AKP and Mr Erdogan were actually committed to the political and economic liberalisation of Turkey as well as to winning a membership in the European Union (EU) while continuing to maintain close ties with Washington and Israel. In fact, not so long ago, many of the same pundits who are now portraying Turkey as the New Iran were arguing that the electoral victories of the AKP and its moderate Western oriented policies at home and abroad demonstrated once again that promoting democracy and free elections in the Middle East would end-up advancing American values and interests. If anything, the outcome of the process of political and economic liberalisation in Turkey highlights once again the fallacy behind the thinking that the American-led export of democracy will help bring the 'good guys' (that is, people like us) to power. That neoconservative axiom helped drive the Bush administration's Freedom Agenda in the Middle East, including its invasion of Iraq, which to their great chagrin, led to electoral victories of the religious Shiite parties, as well as the election of Hamas in Palestine. Marginalised segments In the case of Turkey, the election of the AKP helped bring to power representatives of the formerly marginalised segments of Turkish society that tended to be more traditional in their political-cultural orientation while supportive, not only of free election, but also of some of the free market reforms pursued by the AKP governments. It challenged the statist economic policies of the past and empowered a new generation of entrepreneurs and helped accelerate Turkish economic growth. To apply terms from the lexicon of American politics, political and economic power in Turkey shifted to its own version of America's 'red states' - less secular and statist and more nationalist and populist. It was a mixed bag of ideological position and political agendas that were neither 'pro' nor 'anti' Western, but reflected the evolving values of a new empowered Turkish majority. It eroded the power of the military; modified secular Kemalist policies; started integrating the Kurds into mainstream Turkish society. These and other domestic political changes created in turn the foundations for a more independent foreign policy that was neither 'pro' or 'anti' American but displayed both the new sources of Turkish power, symbolised by its membership in the G-20, as well the constraints operating on it: continuing the drive to join the EU, Turkey's largest market; maintaining the membership in the US-led Nato, including taking part in the war in Afghanistan; strengthening economic and diplomatic ties with Arab neighbours as part of a strategy aimed at stressing the Turkish regional leadership role. Pragmatic policies From that perspective, Turkish policies are very pragmatic, recognising the limits - pressure from the military and the secular middle class and concerns over national interests - of the ability of the AKP to advance a more Islamist agenda at home and abroad. In fact, much of the government's foreign policy seem to be based less on Islamist ideology and more on Realpolitik considerations and economic interests. Ankara refused to permit the US to use its territory to invade Iraq but has worked closely with the current government in Baghdad and improved relations with Iran and Syria as part of an effort to deny Kurdish guerillas safe havens in these countries. And contrary to spin in Washington that portrayed Turkey (and Brazil, another close US ally) as trying to sabotage attempts by the US and its allies to end Iran's nuclear military programme, the accord reached with Teheran, under which the Iranians agreed to deposit 1,200 kg of low grade uranium in Turkey to be exchanged for 120 kg of higher grade uranium in nuclear fuel rods, was very much in line with earlier UN proposals. Nor is the general direction of the Turkish policy towards Israel a demonstration of a new anti-Israeli approach. The serious diplomacy on the part of Mr Erdogan to serve as a mediator between Syria and Israel made a lot of strategic sense, especially at a time when Washington's power in the region has been eroding in the aftermath of the Iraq war, and offered long-term benefits to all those involved in the process, including the Israelis. At the same time, the 2008 Israeli military operation in Gaza ran contrary to the interests of Turkey which was trying to co-opt Hamas and persuade it to moderate its position. The television images of Palestinian civilian casualties in Gaza helped ignite anti-Israeli sentiment in Turkey. It forced Ankara to condemn the Israeli operation. In a way, the tension over the Israeli raid on the Gaza 'Peace Flotilla' is a continuation of the disagreement between Ankara and Jerusalem over the policy towards Hamas. It has resulted in Ankara threatening to cut ties with Israel altogether unless it gets an apology. But the current crisis also demonstrates the need on the part of the Turks and the Israelis to refrain from turning these policy disagreements into confrontation over values and a wide-ranging 'civilisational' conflict. The two governments should take steps to restore their cooperation on a new basis. Israel needs to recognise and support Turkey's determination to play a more activist diplomatic role and take advantage of it and refrain from trying to demonise Turkey as an Islamofascist entity. At the same time, Mr Erdogan and the AKP should appreciate that they do not have the capability to serve as an all powerful regional hegemon, and that in any case, trying to serve as a mediator between the Israelis and the Arabs could prove to be a difficult and thankless job as the Americans have discovered."

He said a final decision would be made by the Palestinian Liberation Organisation executive committee next week. ""It was a very positive meeting and they made a consultative decision on engagement in proximity talks for four months."" In March, a majority of Arab League nations backed the talks, but later retracted the decision after Israel announced it would erect 1600 settler homes in an area of the occupied West Bank that the Israelis annexed to East Jerusalem.

105,The Christian Science Monitor,2010-06-01,Israeli raid on Freedom Flotilla shatters key Turkey-Israel ties; The raid on the Turkish-led Gaza Freedom Flotilla has dealt a harsh blow to Turkey-Israel relations. Ankara's sharp response is strongest signal yet that Turkey may abandon its bid to be regional mediator.,,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"October 8, 2010",1494 words,"One of the greatest diplomatic casualties of the Israeli raid on the Turkish-led Gaza freedom flotilla, which left at least nine dead and dozens injured, may be irreversible damage to Turkey-Israel relations. Following the flotilla raid, Turkey summoned its ambassador to Israel back to Ankara. In remarks made in parliament on Tuesday, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke in harsh terms that seemed to leave little room for an easy rapprochement with Israel. ""This bloody massacre by Israel on ships that were taking humanitarian aid to Gaza deserves every kind of curse. This attack is on international law, the conscience of humanity and world peace,"" he said. IN PICTURES: The Gaza flotilla and the aftermath of the Israeli naval raid ""No one should test Turkey's patience,"" added Mr. Erdogan, who has grown increasingly critical of Israel since the start of the Gaza war in late 2008. ""Turkey's hostility is as strong as its friendship is valuable."" Ankara's harsh response to Israel's action is the strongest signal yet that Turkey may be abandoning its efforts to become a regional mediator between Israel and its Muslim neighbors, favoring instead a more pointed foreign policy. The shift will allow it to capitalize on Muslim frustration with Israel, giving an added boost to its already rising profile in the Middle East. ""This mediation thing is over. Turkey now is one of the sides in the Middle East conflict. It is quite clearly opposed to Israel,"" says Sami Kohen, a veteran Turkish political analyst and columnist who writes for the Milliyet daily. ""This event is almost a climax in this shift."" ""Turkey's hand in the region is strengthened now,"" Mr. Kohen adds. ""There is now more reason for Turkey to take a more active part in the events of the Middle East, since it has suffered personally from this attack. Now it can justify its anti-Israeli positions, which get a good deal of sympathy in the Arab and Islamic world."" New complexities for US alliance Ankara's shift complicates a historic alliance between Turkey and the US, which has become more important in recent years. An air base in southern Turkey is one of the most important transit bases for ferrying troops and supplies to Afghanistan. Turkish mediation, meanwhile, had gotten Israel and Syria back to the peace table until that effort was aborted when the Gaza war broke out. Increased tension between Turkey and Israel clouds one of the few sunny spots the US had previously enjoyed in the region. The deterioration in the once-close relationship between Turkey and Israel has been mirrored by an equally precipitous rise in Turkey's visibility and involvement in the Middle East, an area that it had kept at arm's length for decades because of historical enmity and mutual suspicion. After coming to power in 2002, the government of the liberal Islamic Justice and Development Party (AKP) worked to forge close relations with neighbors such as Syria and Iran. ""It's [an AKP] project whose goal is to set up Turkey as an international player, on the one hand, and to get recognition of Turkey as a moderate, market-friendly leader in the Muslim world and be treated as such in international bodies,"" says Anat Lapidot-Firilla, senior research fellow at the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute. ""The significance of this is that we are going to see more and more Turkish pressure to be involved in regional affairs and global affairs. They are raising the level of their requests and their global aspirations."" A 'juddering halt' to mediation efforts Until recently, Turkey's growing involvement in the Middle East included a desire to parlay its good relations with both Israel and the Arab states into a role as a regional mediator. Ankara, for example, hosted Israel and Syria for a round of (ultimately failed) secret peace talks in 2008. But for now, analysts say, Turkey appears to have abandoned its mediation efforts in the region in return for a more pronounced leadership role in the Middle East. ""For the time being, I don't see any kind of opening for the peace process. So if there isn't any peace process, there isn't any need for the good offices of a mediator,"" says Gencer Ozcan, an expert on Turkey-Israel relations at Istanbul's Bilgi University. Andrew Finkel, a columnist with the English-language daily Today's Zaman, says that Turkey's declared policy of ""zero problems with neighbors"" - which has led Ankara to make groundbreaking moves in its relations with Armenia and Cyprus, for example - has come to a ""juddering halt"" in the case of Israel. ""Instead, Ankara appears to have given its tacit consent to another policy of sharpening contradictions, of trying to lance the boil instead of putting soothing ointment on the blister,"" he says. ""Turkey has always avoided the trap of being in the anti-Israel camp. Also, its relations with Israel have always been an acid test of Turkey being neither fish nor fowl, not being part of the East or the West, that it's not part of an ideological anti-Israel camp,"" Mr. Finkel adds. ""One of Turkey's credentials has been that it's had good relations with Israel and that those relations have paid good dividends in the past."" In previous years, for example, Turkey's close relations with Israel helped it gain access to the halls of power in Washington and to deal with regional intelligence and security issues. Why Palestinians urged Turkey to keep talking to Israel But while Turkey may now earn short-term gains from distancing itself from Israel, there are concerns about the long-term effect of a serious breach between the two countries might have on an already conflict-ridden region. ""Turkey has gradually been losing one of the most significant leverages that it was using in the Arab world,"" says Ozcan. ""Even the Palestinians were telling Ankara to keep talking to the Israelis."" IN PICTURES: The Gaza flotilla and the aftermath of the Israeli naval raid Related: Why Israelis are upset about Israeli raid on Gaza freedom flotilla Why Israel humiliated Turkey in response to a TV show All Turkey news coverage 106 of 266 DOCUMENTS BBC Monitoring South Asia - Political Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring October 8, 2010 Friday Pakistan article expresses concerns over India-Israel defence ties Text of article by Sajjad Shaukat headlined ""India's soft corner for Israel"" published by Pakistani newspaper Pakistan Observer website on 8 October Islamabad, 8 October: India established its diplomatic relations with Israel in 1992, but recently these ties have accelerated as India has a soft corner of Israel. In this connection, in the last week of July this year, Israel hosted a delegation of Indian visiting editors and correspondents. The delegation visited the famous security fence, Jerusalem and Sderot. The members of the group were taken on helicopters along the Israeli border with Gaza and Lebanon. In this respect, Tel Aviv also arranged a briefing regarding recent developments such as increase in humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza, which was exaggerated - the Israeli requirement to secure its coastline in the form of continued sea blockade, economic progress of the West Bank and Israeli efforts for peace. A similar type of trip was also arranged for all the foreign journalists based in Israel. During the second week of July 2010, Tel Aviv had also received a delegation of the Indian parliamentarians for the same purpose after the incident of Israeli attack on the aid flotilla. Notably, that delegation consisted of the members from all the major Indian political parties like Indian National Congress, Bharatiya Janta Party, Biju Janta Dal, Shiromani Akali Dal and Rashtriya Lok Dal. Strengthening of Indo-Israeli ties could also be judged from the fact that when this delegation of Indian parliamentarians met Israeli president, in his speech, he admitted the Indian culture and political wisdom, while comparing the Indian leader Mahatama Gandhi with one of the earlier Prophet of the Bani-Israel. It is of particular attention that in the recent past, Israel received worldwide condemnation in wake of protests due to its brutal attack on the naval aid flotilla which was carrying basic necessities of life for the besieged people of Gaza. In this regard, Tel Aviv felt politically isolated. But India is one of the countries which did not openly condemn Israeli action. However, this new move to invite the media and parliamentarian delegations, starting with New Delhi is an effort of Israel to improve its image in the world. In this context, having soft corner for Israel, India hastened to send its two delegations. It is notable that both India and Israel which had openly jumped on Bush's anti-terrorism enterprise in the aftermath of September 11 catastrophe, are covertly supported American agenda of neo-conservatives by acting upon a secret diplomacy, targeting Pakistan, China and Iran in particular and some other countries of the region like Syria and Lebanon in general. In this context, proper media coverage was not given to the Indo-Israeli secret diplomacy, which could be assessed from the interview of Israel's ambassador to India, Mark Sofer published in the Indian weekly Outlook on February 18, 2008. Regarding India's defence arrangements with Israel, Sofer had surprisingly disclosed ""We do have a defence relationship with India, which is no secret. On the other hand, what is secret is the defence relationship"". And ""with all due respect, the secret part will remain a secret."" Indo-Israeli nexus remained under wraps till 2003, when Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon visited India to officially reveal it. In this respect, Indian 'The Tribune' wrote on September 10, 2003, ""India and Israel took giant leaps forward in bolstering the existing strategic ties and forging new ones"" and Tel Aviv has ""agreed to share its expertise with India in various fields like anti-fidayeen operations, surveillance satellites, and intelligence sharing and space exploration."" From anti-missile systems to hi-tech radars, from sky drones to night-vision equipment, Indo-Israeli defense cooperation has known no bounds in recent times. Recent defence purchases by New Delhi from Tel Aviv include fast attack naval craft, electronic warfare system and unmanned aerial vehicles. Besides, Indian secret deal entails submarine launched cruise missiles, micro-satellite systems, laser guided systems etc. The matter is not confined to purchasing of military equipments only, Indo-Israeli overt and covert links are part of a dangerous strategic game in Asia. In this connection, the then Israeli premier, Benjamin Netanyahu had already made it clear in July 1997 saying, ""Our ties with India don't have any limitations--as long as India and Israel are friendly, it is a strategic gain"". There are other reasons behind Indo-Israeli secret nexus. Fast growing economic power of China coupled with her rising strategic relationship with the Third World has been misperceived by the Americans and Indians. Owing to this jealousy, tactical support of Washington to New Delhi, indirect military aid through Israel, the US-India nuclear deal--all are part of American desire to make India a major power to counterbalance China in Asia as both of them see Beijing a ""future strategic competitor"". On the other side, a 'nuclearized' Pakistan, depending upon minimum deterrence, having close ties with Beijing is another major target of the Indo-Israeli secret diplomacy. As regards Islamabad, India, Afghanistan and Israel are in collusion as part of a plot to 'destabilize' Pakistan for their common strategic interests.The fact of the matter is that by availing the ongoing international phenomena of terrorism, Jewish-Hindu lobbies are collectively working in America and other European countries to exploit the double standards of the west in relation to terrorism and human rights vis-Ã - vis Pakistan and China. Israel and India are equating the 'war of independence' in Kashmir and Palestine with terrorism. If India considers Pakistan as its enemy number one, Israel takes Iran in the same sense--especially due to its nuclear programme which is also negated by the US. Tel Aviv is also against Pakistan as it is the only nuclear Islamic country. However, these similarities of interest have brought the two countries to follow a common secret diplomacy with the tactical support of Washington, targeting particularly Pakistan and China including other states like Nepal, North Korea, Bangladesh, Iran, Syria etc. The cause of concern to Pakistan and the Muslim world, however, has little to do with India-Israel trade relations. It concerns the 'secret' defence ties referred to by Mr. Sofer. While already analyzing these in the December 6, 2004 edition of The Middle Eastern Review of International Affairs (Meria), Harsh V. Pant wrote, ""A flourishing Indo-Israeli relationship has the potential to make a significant impact on global politics by altering the balance of power, not only in South Asia and the Middle East, but also in the larger Asian region."" Another regrettable point is that irresponsible attitude of some Indian, Israeli and Western politicians has introduced dangerous socio-religious dimension in their societies by equating the ""war on terror"" with ""war on Islam"" and acts of Al Qaeda with all the Muslims. Their media have also been contributing to heighten the currents of world politics on cultural and religious lines with the negative projection of Islam. In this connection, reprinting of the caricatures about Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and release of a Dutch film against the Holy Quran in the recent past might be noted as an example. It is because of these developments that a greater resentment is being found among the Muslims who think that the US in connivance with the Indo-Israeli lobbies is sponsoring state terrorism, directly or indirectly from Kashmir to Palestine. Nevertheless, by manipulating the present phenomena of world terrorism and anti-Muslim approach of the west, both India and Israel have been availing this golden opportunity to achieve their covert goals by convincing the US-led European states that a 'nuclearized' Pakistan is sponsoring cross-border terrorism in Afghanistan and Kashmir. And Iran and Syria are doing the same act in Iraq and Lebanon. In this regard, equation of 'war of liberation' in Kashmir and Palestine with terrorism has become the main target of New Delhi and Tel Aviv which intend to divert the attenti on of the west from their own atrocities, being perpetrated in the occupied territories. Most alarming point in this respect is that Indo-Israeli nexus for the sake of delaying the solution of Kashmir and Palestine--under the pretext of so-called Islamic terrorism is not only sabotaging world peace, but is also taking the world to the brink of clash of civilizations. Nonetheless, Indian silence or sluggish policy over Israeli atrocities in Gazas, Palestinians, intervention in Lebanon, a deadly attack on the aid flotilla and Tel Aviv's violations of a number of UN resolutions show that without any doubt, India has a soft corner for Israel owing to its secret strategic interests.

107,BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-12-02,Sudan writer says WikiLeaks represents worst scandal for USA,,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"December 2, 2010",,"Text of report by private Sudanese newspaper Alwan on 2 December The mischief of the United States has boomeranged. Its economy has been dismantled by the financial crisis, with hundreds of banks going bankrupt and millions of jobs lost. Its foreign policy came apart with the WikiLeaks scandal. Its national security was hit by the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan in a war that costs 370,000 US dollars every hour, or 1.5 trillion US dollars annually. These are statistics compiled by the expert who won the Nobel Prize for economy. The United States entered this war without deposits and borrowed to finance it. They describe naked children in Sudan as being ""as Allah created them"". Similarly, the United States has become after the WikiLeaks scandal naked before the world. American policy has been jolted by many scandals such as Watergate at the outset of the 1970s which ended in President Nixon's resignation. There was also the Iran-Contra scandal in the second half of the 1980s which nearly toppled President Ronald Reagan. The Monica Lewinsky scandal nearly toppled President Clinton. But the WikiLeaks scandal is of a completely different calibre. It is a nuclear scandal that exposed the naked face of US policy. WikiLeaks have ended the global credibility and respect of the United States and proclaimed its political and moral bankruptcy. After WikiLeaks, the United States has become in the eyes of the world as naked as the day it was born. It has lost all diplomacy, prestige, credibility, and respect. WikiLeaks is the biggest scandal for US policy--the scandal of the twenty-first century. Since its establishment, the United States has not faced a scandal of similar proportions. The ramifications of the WikiLeaks will continue for a time to become before the United States restores its credibility and regains the initiative. WikiLeaks have swept away the global reputation of the United States just like typhoons sweep away the huts of the poor in the Caribbean Islands. As for Sudan, Hillary Clinton ordered spying on the United Nations in Sudan and on world leaders including Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The secret WikiLeaks documents that have been published revealed that Mossad chief Meir Dagan met with the representatives of the US Congress on 13 March. The two sides discussed the issue of foreign combatants in Iraq, meaning volunteers from the Arab and Islamic countries who fight on the side of the Iraqi resistance against American occupation forces. Meir Dagan said that the foreign combatants fighting American forces in Iraq will return to their nations in Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Lebanon to set up armed organizations that threaten stability in the region, armed organizations hostile to the United States that threaten American interests and ultimately threaten Israel. Mossad Chief Meir Dagan said at the meeting with the representatives of Congress, among them Senator John Cornyn, that Israel had proof that the foreign combatant mujahidin who came from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Syria have returned to their countries and that some of those from Saudi Arabia have returned to Saudi Arabia. The Mossad chief predicted that the returnees, like those who fought in the Afghan jihad in the 1980s and 1990s, will remain in contact with one another and form a network on the basis of their joint experiences in Iraq. Meir Dagan said that Israel had no interests in Iraq except for its friendship with the Kurds but that the attention it pays to Iraq centers on the effect of the mujahidin who fought alongside the resistance on the nations to which they will return, for instance what they will do in Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Meir said he expected that Egypt and Jordan would ""do what is required"" concerning the mujahidin returning from Iraq but that Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Lebanon are not sufficiently prepared to face the internal challenge posed by the returning mujahidin. He said that their military training and the absence of strong governments willing and capable of confronting them will have destructive effects on Israel through the anarchy they will cause in their countries. The question remains on whether the storm caused by the WikiLeaks scandal will topple President Obama or only Secretary of State Hillary Clinton? Will the United States contrive a new, sensational adventure to drown out WikiLeaks, or will the American Administration bow to the storm until further notice?

108,BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-12-21,Commentary urges Jordan to foster closer ties with Iran,,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"December 21, 2010",,"Text of report by Jordanian newspaper Al-Arab al-Yawm on 19 December [Column by Rana Sabbagh: ""Building Bridges With Iran . . Opportunity for Diversifying Options and Repositioning""] Preparations are under way for holding a Jordanian-Iranian summit in early 2011 in a way that will most likely help in boosting mutual interests on the economic, trade, tourism, and security levels and that eases the sharpness of the political altercations between two countries, which have been revolving for years in two contradictory orbits: ""moderation"" and ""objection."" The first meeting between King Abdallah II and President Ahmadinezhad, after his election to a second presidential term, is expected to help in diversifying Jordan's basket of diplomatic options in a changing region, which has been witnessing competition for dividing influence between America and its ally, Israel, on the one hand and Iran and Turkey on the other since the 2003 fall of Baghdad - Jordan's strategic depth in the past. It will also help in the desired repositioning of Jordan to protect its interests and allow the government to gain popularity in a society whose components are witnessing growing opposition to the policies of the United States, which places the interests of Israel above the security and stability of its Arab allies, including the Kingdom. Therefore, some politicians and diplomats do not rule out that the upcoming meeting in Amman or Tehran will anger America and Israel on the one hand and Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the UAE - the other three members of the quartet of moderate Arab countries - on the other. Four years ago, Jordan pushed for forming this quartet in the context of protecting the interests of these countries in the face of Iran's expansion and America's failure. According to Jordanian politicians, Israel has started to incite America and warn of the consequences of rapprochement between Jordan and Iran, which is locked in a confrontation with the West over its nuclear file, amid continuing threats to launch Israeli or NATO military action to abort its nuclear capabilities, in a new showdown that might turn the entire region into a centre of fires and disasters. In the view of a number of politicians, this sensitivity is not justified. Any rapprochement in relations does not at all mean a strategic turnabout that throws Jordan in the Iranian lap away from the political, military, and economic alliance between Amman and Washington. This alliance has deepened over the past decade. Jordan is committed to a higher strategy, whose red lines prevent harming the alliance with America and Jordan's relations with Israel in line with the peace treaty that was signed in 1994. However, compliance with the determinants of action within the US frameworks has made Jordan pay a heavy price and restricted its diplomatic role in the region's outstanding files: Palestine, Iraq, and Lebanon. The former administration had asked Jordan to support the peace process, act within the framework of the moderate countries, back Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas, keep away from Syria, not to talk with Iran, besiege HAMAS, and boycott Hizballah. Today, the time has come for Amman to choose to play within the possible area of tactics. The recent Jordanian-Iranian rapprochement was not conceived on the spur of the moment, but was the outcome of the accumulation of mutual initiatives for breaking the ice, especially since the visit of Ahmadinezhad to Lebanon two months ago. At the time, the Iranian president phoned King Abdallah II and the Saudi king on the eve of this visit. The two leaders spoke about ""bilateral relations and the general situation in the region."" Jordan's official relations with the Syrian leadership have improved a lot, as Bashar al-Asad announced recently. Jordan felt that Iran is extending its hand towards it, certainly, to serve its interests and perhaps to send signals to the West. Since then, contacts have started between the two sides, but silently, at the level of the Royal Palace and the Presidential Bureau of the Iranian Republic to follow up the effects of th e ""positive phone call."" These efforts have resulted in the visit of Rahim Masha'i, director of President Ahmadinezhad's office, to Amman last week. Masha'i was received at the airport by Engineer Nasir al-Lawzi, chief of the Royal Court. He then met with the king and handed him a letter from the Iranian president that included an official invitation to visit Tehran. In the letter, the Iranian president also expressed the desire to boost bilateral relations and thanked Jordan for its ""positive stands"" at Western forums because of its rejection of the military option against Iran. The king has sent a similar invitation to President Ahmadinezhad. Several days later, he sent a cable in which he expressed his deep condolences over the martyrs of the recent bombing, which was claimed by the Jundallah organization. Amman hopes to host the first summit meeting. It is willing to get over a stage in which the government pursued a cautious policy towards Iran and kept the volume of the two-way trade exchange and economic relations between the two countries at a modest level, which does not exceed $10 million. Today, Amman should appoint a Jordanian ambassador in Tehran to fill a post, which has been vacant for months, to avoid the continuation of the diplomatic vacuum. Tehran sent a new ambassador to Jordan several months ago. In brief statements following his arrival, the new ambassador said that he is coming to give a strong boost to bilateral relations, based on instructions from President Ahmadinezhad. Opening up to Iran and ""clearing any confusion"" with this country serves the interests of Jordan in the long run, because it is impossible to continue to link its position towards Tehran to the US-Iranian formula. In fact, this has become necessary after the collapse of the Middle East peace process, which Jordan and the majority of the Arabs have wagered on since the start of negotiations in 1991. The two leaders can search for common ground that is based on economic and trade interests, backed by the elements of geography and history, and that helps in narrowing the political disagreement in the world of diplomacy, which is based on the art of the impossible. Jordan will benefit a great deal from a tactical, and not strategic change towards Iran, especially after the decline of the regional role of Saudi Arabia and Egypt in front of the rise of Iran and Turkey, and also in light of America's failure to impose peace and the loss of its influence in the region. Washington has failed to convince Tel Aviv to extend the settlement freeze for three more months despite the basket of tempting political and security incentives on the table of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. In Iraq, the attempt to form the latest government has taken several months and ended in reappointing Nuri al-Maliki, who is close to Iran. These formulas definitely prove that Iran has a greater say than the US Administration in Iraq. Iran has continued to boost its presence in the region through the Baghdad gateway since the fall of the Saddam Husayn regime in front of the US invasion. It enjoys influence and strong ties with Syria, Hizballah, and HAMAS. It also has influence, to varying degrees, on the Shi'i components inside many countries in the region. Better relations with Iran help Jordan to serve its interests in Iraq, for example, through setting up stronger economic relations through the leaders, who are close to Tehran, and to get more oil at preferential prices amid crushing economic conditions. Was Iran not behind the recent economic openness between Iraq and Syria, after decades of tension and estrangement? The WikiLeaks documents revealed that some countries in the moderate Arab camp describe the Iranian infiltration into the region, especially in Lebanon, Iraq, and the Palestinian arena, as an octopus. In light of this, it is certain that better relations with I ran will prevent targeting Jordan by these ""arms,"" which will change their viewpoint towards Amman through Tehran's spectacles. Better relations might enable Jordan to play a role to end the nuclear crisis between Iran and the West and to help it to make Iran understand that its interest in the long term is achieved through talking with the legitimate governments in the Arab world, and not through coordinating with parties inside these countries. It might serve the higher interest if coordination among the moderate countries takes place before the summit meeting. Once this happens, the king will be able to talk with Iran from these countries' viewpoint towards important issues that affect the security and stability of the region. This might also help Jordan to intervene to achieve reconciliation between HAMAS and Fatah, after the efforts of Saudi Arabia and Egypt have failed. Such reconciliation will strengthen the Arab and Islamic position towards the Palestinian file when talking with America and Israel. Coordinating with the moderate countries before the meeting is also necessary in order not to accuse Jordan later of ""conspiring,"" for example, against the interests of the PNA in favour of HAMAS if it launches a campaign to achieve reconciliation between the Palestinian brothers. Even if Jordanian officials, especially security officials, feel that Iran is targeting the Kingdom, why don't politicians sit with each other to ease the tension? Jordan today stands in the eye of the storm, as it heads into the hardest year that might be witnessed by the region. Its interest lies in diversifying its diplomatic tools and options and reducing the huge amount of US and Israeli political pressures and Gulf economic pressures. All the moderate [Arab] capitals should accept for Amman what they accept for themselves. Amman also clearly knows what it wants from Tehran, and there is no room for bargaining; that is, not interfering in the internal Arab affairs and not forming alliances with groups and parties inside these countries. It also wants a diplomatic solution to the nuclear file. Jordan's interest is achieved through positive engagement with Iran to serve the Jordanian and Arab interests and reduce the Iranian domination in the region.

The Americans are leaving, and the Iranians, the Turks, the Syrians, and many others are coming in. Destabilizing interference is increasing; each one of our neighbours wants to have his say. It is a huge problem for our future and not only for ours. I have tried to communicate many many times with Washington recently: If they lose Afghanistan, it is only one country; if they lose Iraq, they lose the Middle East. But I do not think that they have understood."" [Iraqi Foreign Minister] Hoshyar Zebari was making no secret of his alarmed disappointment with US policy in the region. Foreign minister in the several governments that have led the ""new Iraq"" since the war in 2003, he has never hidden his Kurdish identity (born in the Arbil area in 1953, he was the spokesman of the Kurdish Democratic Party), and he is a cousin of Babakir Zebari, a staff general who caused quite a fuss and sparked a little tension with Washington recently on account of his highly sceptical public statements regarding the new national Army's ability to hold out once the US troops have pulled out. Zebari received us in his office for almost an hour. [Cremonesi] Do you, too, think that it is going to take at least another 10 years for the national security forces to be in a position to control Iraq? [Zebari] The Army and the police force have grown a lot. Their development has been astonishing in terms of their degree of training, the number of men, and their equipment and resources. But I think that my cousin Babakir's remarks may have been misunderstood. He was referring to their ability to monitor our borders. One thing is combating domestic subversion, while being prepared for the eventuality of an attack by an external foe is something else. In the former instance, I truly believe that the Army and the police force are ready. But not in the latter. We need an air force, combat planes, and a navy capable of efficiently patrolling the waters of the Gulf and the oil terminals. We need radar, we need the ability to coordinate our land and airborne forces. The vacuum left by the US troops in those areas remains serious and it is going to take time before we are able to fill it. [Cremonesi] Did you prefer Bush to Obama? [Zebari] Bush was a decision maker: He made decisions and he acted on them, even at the risk of making mistakes, even if he knew that he was unpopular. With Obama, on the other hand, initiatives stop halfway. He is not moving forward with the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, he is not moving forward in Lebanon, and things are going badly in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. I see no successful achievements, despite the intense commitment. [Cremonesi] Do you fear that the United States is too passive? Do you think that it is leaving Iraq in the lurch? [Zebari] The United States will not leave Iraq in the lurch. Its interests here are too strong. It has one of its largest embassies precisely in Baghdad and it has just opened consulates in Basra and in Arbil, as well as offices in Kirkuk and in Mosul. But it is true that its new policy is having a deep impact on us. I went to Washington a few weeks ago precisely in order to sound the alarm bell: Be careful, you have to do more; you are in danger of only half-finishing the job; you have a role to maintain here; you have to work with greater energy. For instance, US passivity is delaying the formation of our government. There were far fewer problems at the election in 2005, and foreign interference was virtually nonexistent back then. Today the opposite is true. Turks, Iranians, Syrians, Saudis, and many others are getting in the way. If the Obama administration had been more active in working for mediation, we would probably have a new government in Baghdad by now and we would be far less weak. [Cremonesi] But over five months have gone by since the parliamentary elections on 7 March. The Iraqis are accusing their politic al class of egotism and of blindness. Few point the finger of accusation at the United States. Do you not consider it your specific duty to come up with a compromise formula for the new coalition? [Zebari] Actually, the final results of the vote came through only in May and that was when negotiations really got under way. The trouble is that no one wants to be in opposition. And in any case, it is clear that the delay in forming a government cannot leave the forces of subversion any lebensraum. Al-Qa'idah, terrorism, and sectarianism are proliferating in this deadlock situation. I would say that the Iraqis have been exceedingly patient. [Cremonesi] Do you think that Iran might intervene against US interests in Iraq in the event of an attack on its nuclear reactors? [Zebari] That seems like a remote threat to me. As of 1 September, US presence will be restricted to 50,000 troops who are staying behind to train our security forces. [Cremonesi] What do you think of the rise of Islamic components in Turkey? [Zebari] It is a serious problem. The Turks have recently been interfering with increasing aggressiveness in Lebanon, in Syria, in Gaza, and in Iraq. They have not achieved a great deal, but their activism is unprecedented and I sincerely believe that it needs to be counterbalanced. Source: Corriere della Sera, Milan, in Italian 18 Aug 10"

""There is no reason to have any doubts about Turkey,"" Abdullah Gül, the President, declared in a forceful interview with The Times designed to allay alarm in Europe and America about its increasingly close relations with radical Middle East regimes. Turkey was not ""lost"", he said, denouncing such claims as ""unacceptable"" and emphasising that Turkey was also forging ties far beyond the Arab world. ""I consider it very wrong to interpret Turkey's interests with other geographic regions as it breaking from the West, turning its back on the West or seeking alternatives to the West. Turkey is part of Europe."" Mr Gül argued that the US and Europe should welcome its growing engagement in the Middle East because it was promoting Western values in a region largely governed by authoritarian regimes. Rebuking some Western politicians for their outdated views of Turkey, he insisted that the country had undergone a ""silent revolution"". It was now a big economic power that had embraced democracy, human rights and the free market. It had become a ""source of inspiration"" in the region. ""If this is not acknowledged, it's a pity,"" Mr Gül lamented. Turkey is a strategically vital country of 72 million people that straddles the border of Europe and Asia, has Nato's second-largest army and is a supply hub for US war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. It has also caused consternation in Western capitals in recent months. Not only has it welcomed President Ahmadinejad of Iran and congratulated him on his stolen election victory, it also voted against UN sanctions to try to halt the Iranian nuclear programme. The nation has lent support to Hamas, which is on the USandEUlists of terrorist organisations. ""We are respecting the choice of the Palestinian people in Gaza,""MrGül said. It was preparing to host President al-Bashir of Sudan, who is wanted for crimes against humanity, at an Islamic conference until theEUobjected. It has assiduously courted Syria, with whom it nearly went to war in 1998. At the same time, Turkey has condemned Israel, formerly its closest regional ally and supplier of much of its military hardware, over its invasion of Gaza and the recent killing of nine Turkish civilians on a Gaza-bound flotilla by Israeli commandos. Apart from one secret ministerial meeting this week, relations are frozen, with Turkey demanding an apology and compensation. Mr Gül insisted that Turkey had always been Israel's friend but asked: ""If an army of a state kills your people in international waters, how would you react?"" From America, particularly, there have been clear signs of displeasure and mutterings about how the ruling AK Party is returning to its Islamic roots. President Obama had a frosty meeting with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Prime Minister, at last weekend's G20 summit. ""We think Turkey remains committed to Nato, Europe and the US, but that needs to be demonstrated,"" Philip Gordon, the Administration's top European diplomat, said. Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist, expressed shock at finding ""Turkey's Islamic Government seemingly focused not on joining the EU, but the Arab League-no, scratch that, on joining the Hamas-Hezbollah-Iran resistance front against Israel."" Mr Gül admitted that there was ""a gap between perception and reality and it needs some clarification"". Speaking in his summer residence overlooking the Bosphorus, he described a country that has Europe's fastest - and almost only - expanding economy, with 11 per cent growth in the first quarter of this year alone and the continent's most stable financial system. Turkey's growing economic strength was matched by an increasingly ambitious and independent foreign policy-one driven by trade and based on engagement, not confrontation. ""We used to implement other people's programmes,"" he noted. Iran, with whom Turkey enjoys blossoming trade and from whom it imports a third of its gas, was a case in point, he said. Mr Gül said Turkey did not believe that sanctions would stop Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons and feared that they would lead to another disastrous war like that in Iraq. As a neighbour it stood to lose most, so it had combined with Brazil to broker a confidence-building agreement with Iran on exchanging uranium. ""We thought it would be appreciated,"" Mr Gül said. When the US and its European allies pressed ahead with UN sanctions anyway, ""we were surprised"". In the end Turkey voted against the sanctions to keep its own deal on the table. In many ways Turkey's growing activism in its own backyard has served it well. Its trade with the Middle East has jumped from $1.9 billion in 1991 to more than $23 billion last year. Trade with Iran alone has risen more than 500 per cent since 2002, with about 75,000 lorries a year crossing their mutual border. Turkey's standing in the region has soared, with Mr Erdogan lauded in the proverbial Arab street for standing up to Israel. Turkish TV is now watched across the Middle East, and relaxed visa restrictions mean that Arabs are flocking to Turkey. Mr Gül argued that the West should welcome this engagement, saying that millions of Arabs were comparing Turkey's success with their own countries. ""Our friends in the West should appreciate that Turkey is indirectly spreading all these values in our neighbourhood,"" he said. The President's colleagues also argue that Turkey's engagement allows it to act as mediator and messenger in an area generally hostile to the West, and counters Iranian influence. Mr Gül said that Turkey's relationship with Syria helped to achieve stability in Lebanon. Other officials cited Turkey's efforts to mediate between Israel and Syria, and reconcile Iraq's Sunnis and Shias. Turkey also intervened when Iranians working for the British Embassy in Tehran were arrested last year. ""The trust and confidence we have built up in Iran is an asset not only for Turkey but also for the international community,"" Egemen Bagis, Turkey's chief EU negotiator, said. For Mehmet Altan, economics professor at Istanbul University, the problem is that the engagement policy - dubbed ""zero problems with neighbours"" - promotes free trade but ignores the human rights violations of Turkey's new partners. ""At the very least, dealing with these countries without insisting on human rights and democracy doesn't increase Turkey's chances of joining the EU,"" he said. That is Turkey's gamble: that its relations with unsavoury Middle Eastern regimes will ultimately attract, not repel, those in the West by whom it is so anxious to be accepted.

Turkey's growing economic strength was matched by an increasingly ambitious and independent foreign policy - one driven by trade and based on engagement, not confrontation. ""We used to implement other people's programmes,"" he noted. Iran, with whom Turkey enjoys blossoming trade and from whom it imports a third of its gas, was a case in point, he said. Mr Gül said Turkey did not believe that sanctions would stop Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons and feared that they would lead to another disastrous war like that in Iraq. As a neighbour it stood to lose most, so it had combined with Brazil to broker a confidence-building agreement with Iran on exchanging uranium. ""We thought it would be appreciated,"" Mr Gül said. When the US and its European allies pressed ahead with UN sanctions anyway, ""we were surprised"". In the end Turkey voted against the sanctions to keep its own deal on the table. Mr Gül refused to comment on last year's stolen election in Iran, saying it was a domestic issue. In many ways Turkey's growing activism in its own backyard has served it well. Its trade with the Middle East has jumped from $1.9 billion in 1991 to more than $23 billion last year. Trade with Iran alone has risen more than 500 per cent since 2002, with about 75,000 lorries a year crossing their mutual border. Turkey's standing in the region has soared, with Mr Erdogan lauded in the proverbial Arab street for standing up to Israel. Turkish TV is now watched across the Middle East, and relaxed visa restrictions mean that Arabs are flocking to Turkey. Mr Gül argued that the West should welcome this engagement, saying that millions of Arabs were comparing Turkey's success with their own countries. ""Our friends in the West should appreciate that Turkey is indirectly spreading all these values in our neighbourhood,"" he said. The President's colleagues also argue that Turkey's engagement allows it to act as mediator and messenger in an area generally hostile to the West, and counters Iranian influence. Mr Gül said that Turkey's relationship with Syria helped to achieve stability in Lebanon. Other officials cited Turkey's efforts to mediate between Israel and Syria, and reconcile Iraq's Sunnis and Shias. Turkey also intervened when Iranians working for the British Embassy in Tehran were arrested last year. ""The trust and confidence we have built up in Iran is an asset not only for Turkey but also for the international community,"" Egemen Bagis, Turkey's chief EU negotiator, said. For Mehmet Altan, economics professor at Istanbul University, the problem is that the engagement policy - dubbed ""zero problems with neighbours"" - promotes free trade but ignores the human rights violations of Turkey's new partners. ""At the very least, dealing with these countries without insisting on human rights and democracy doesn't increase Turkey's chances of joining the EU,"" he said. That is Turkey's gamble: that its relations with unsavoury Middle Eastern regimes will ultimately attract, not repel, those in the West by whom it is so anxious to be accepted. Two soldiers and 12 militants were killed when fighters from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party attacked a military outpost near Pervari in Siirt province on Wednesday night. Three local militiamen working for the military were also killed.

112,Jerusalem Post,2010-10-10,Arab League gives US a month to keep direct talks aliveGrace period ends just after American congressional elections,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,NEWS; Pg. 1,"February 22, 2011",892 words,"Israel and the US will continue intensive efforts to ensure direct Israeli-Palestinian talks following the Arab League's decision to give American mediators another month to find a formula to keep the talks from collapsing, government officials said on Saturday night. The Arab League's foreign ministers, in a much-anticipated meeting in Libya on Friday, coupled the league's decision to proffer a month of grace - which will end just after November 2's US midterm elections - with a declaration of support for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas's refusal to negotiate unless Israel renews the settlement construction moratorium. ""We support the Palestinian president's position calling for a complete halt of all settlement activities in order to resume negotiation,"" the Arab League's deputy secretary-general, Ahmad Bin Helli, said as he read a statement issued after the ministerial meeting. But the ministers said they would resume meetings in a month to study alternatives and decide on the next steps, giving the United States extra time. The month-long grace period ensures that if the talks do collapse, it won't happen until after the US elections. The Democratic Party is struggling to retain control of Congress, and a high-profile foreign policy failure for President Barack Obama at this time would only further hurt his party's electoral chances. Israel had no formal response to the Arab League decision, though it was widely expected in Jerusalem that the League - under intense US pressure - would find a way to avoid bringing down the talks at this time. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who did not issue a statement following the meeting in Libya, may address it at the opening of the cabinet meeting on Sunday. It will certainly be raised when he meets with visiting French and Spanish foreign ministers Bernard Kouchner and Miguel Moratinos, also on Sunday. PA officials expressed satisfaction with the Arab League decision. Nabil Abu Rudaineh, a spokesman for the PA leadership, expressed hope that the 30-day period would give the US administration enough time to find a solution to the issue of settlement construction. He also expressed satisfaction with the Arab League's endorsement of Abbas's stance on the future of the peace talks. The spokesman said that if the Americans failed to convince the government to extend the freeze, the league would meet in a month to decide on the future of the peace process. A PA official in Ramallah said that the Arab League supported Abbas's idea to seek US or UN recognition of a Palestinian state on the June 4, 1967 lines if the talks collapsed. ""The Palestinian leadership will give the US administration another chance to solve the [settlement construction] crisis,"" he said. ""If their efforts fail in the next 30 days, we will go to the Americans and the United Nations [regarding statehood]."" The Arab ministers called on Washington to pressure Israel to halt settlement construction to pursue efforts to create the appropriate conditions to revive the peace process. The ministers, who were briefed by Abbas on the crisis surrounding the talks, also called for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital. They said that an agreement on this issue should be reached by September 2011. Abbas hinted again that he might resign and dismantle the PA if the peace process did not move forward. He told the Arab ministers that he saw no point in the continued existence of the PA if the peace talks failed to achieve an independent state. US State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley welcomed the Arab League's backing for giving more time for peace negotiations to take place. ""We appreciate the Arab League's statement of support for our efforts to create conditions that will allow direct talks to move forward,"" Crowley said in a statement. ""We will continue to work with the parties, and all our international partners, to advance negotiations toward a two-state solution and encourage the parties to take constructive actions toward that end."" The chief Palestinian negotiator in the peace talks, Saeb Erekat, sought to keep the pressure on Israel. ""The Israeli government was given the choice between peace and settlements, and it has chosen settlements,"" Erekat said. ""It [Israel] alone bears the responsibility for this."" Delegates at Friday's meeting said the ministers made their decision after Abbas explained that he faced stiff opposition in the Palestinian territories to returning to the talks. They also said some of Friday's discussions centered on the need to delay a final decision until the US congressional elections so the Obama administration would not face as much political pressure. Hamas dismissed the Arab foreign ministers' decision as ""a waste of time."" A statement from the group's Syrian-based leadership said the Palestinians should end all negotiations and return to armed resistance. Hamas also called for the Palestinians to focus on restoring unity, in reference to efforts to end its split with Fatah. Syria opposed any attempt to go back to the talks. ""I cannot see any benefit from this meeting,"" said Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem, who stayed away from the Libya meeting and instead sent Syria's envoy to the Arab League. Lebanon boycotted the discussions altogether because of a dispute with Libya."
113,Gulf News (United Arab Emirates),2010-01-13,Al Assad arrives in Riyadh today for summit talks,,57,Newspaper,,James Denselowguardian.co.uk,ENGLISH,,"April 14, 2010",776 words,"Riyadh Syrian President Bashar Al Assad will arrive here today on a landmark official visit -- a further sign of the thaw in relations between the two key Arab states. The visit would follow Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al Faisal's visit to Damascus last week. The Egyptian-brokered reconciliation agreement between the leading Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iranian nuclear dossier and the situation in Lebanon would figure high in the talks. ""During the Saudi-Syrian summit talks, the leaders will discuss ways to further strengthen bilateral relations and cooperation in various fields, in addition to the regional and international issues of mutual concern,"" the official Saudi Press Agency reported. Framework Syrian ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Mahdi Dakhlallah, said that Al Assad's visit comes in the framework of hectic political activities in the Arab world to revive the peace process as well as to work out a united Arab position toward the hostile Israeli acts. The two leaders will review the latest situation on the Arab and regional arenas, especially the recent armed infiltration of Al Houthi rebels along the Kingdom's southern border with Yemen, and the Iranian nuclear programme that poses a threat to the Gulf and Arab region, he said. 114 of 266 DOCUMENTS Morning Star July 29, 2010 Thursday Comment - Lessons to be learned US Senate foreign relations committee chairman Robert Menendez is livid that British citizens don't wish to testify to his committee over the release from jail in Scotland of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. The committee is obsessed with the theory, for which there is no evidence, that a BP oil deal with Libya and a Britain-Libya prisoner transfer agreement are linked to Megrahi's release on compassionate grounds. Menendez called off today's committee hearing after accusing Scottish ministers Alex Salmond, Kenny MacAskill, Scottish Prison Service medical director Dr Andrew Fraser, former foreign secretary Jack Straw and BP officials Sir Mark Allen and Tony Hayward of having 'stonewalled."" ""They would prefer to sweep this under the rug,"" he charged, calling it ""utterly disappointing and, I think, pretty outrageous that none of these key witnesses will co-operate with our request to answer questions before the Senate foreign relations committee."" The noble senator seems not to understand that Scottish officials who took the decision answer to Scottish institutions and have already done so. Although they owe no fealty to his committee or any other US body, Salmond has provided full written information about his government's entirely appropriate decision. What Menendez wants is not additional information but the opportunity to grandstand for political purposes on prime-time TV, slamming Libya, Scottish ministers and the prisoner transfer agreement, while absolving its co-signatory and proud US vassal Tony Blair. They should be thankful that Salmond didn't ask George Galloway to testify on his behalf, given his previous unforgettable performance in Washington. Galloway may well have reprised his accused-turned-accuser role to demand consideration of why Libya was suddenly singled out for blame for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing when, for three years after it, US security services believed it a reprisal for the USS Vincennes downing of an Iranian civilian plane the previous month, killing 290 people. The CIA cited the Palestinian group PFLP (GC) as having carried out the atrocity at the behest of Iran and Syria, but Syria vanished from this plot following its welcome into the coalition to invade Iraq in 1991 after Baghdad's occupation of Kuwait. Galloway would surely have suggested that Menendez's committee might have better targets for investigation closer to home. These could include the unjust imprisonment in the US of five Cuban patriots for the ""crime"" of infiltrating and exposing the terrorist plans of anti-Cuba fanatics in Miami. Another suitable case for treatment would be ongoing US refuge for anti-Cuba terrorist Luis Posada Carriles, who carried out the 1976 bombing of a Cuban plane over Barbados, killing 73 people. Menendez and his committee should learn a little humility, respect other countries' independence and accept that their country is not the beacon for justice it purports to be. 115 of 266 DOCUMENTS Guardian.com April 14, 2010 Wednesday Forgetting Iraq in the election James Denselow: Responsibility for the situation in the 'new' Iraq should trump British politicians' attempts to avoid the issue in party manifestos The playwright David Hare to Neil Kinnock in G2 this week: how could he vote Labour after Iraq? Despite having an entire interview to give a clear answer, the former Labour leader ducked the question entirely by saying that ""you can't be chained to past events over which you can now have even less control"". Iraq has become a toxic issue that is avoided at all costs by the two largest parties in their election campaigns. The Labour manifesto outlined that ""there is no more important part of the world for global security than the Middle East"", but the 76-page document only mentions Iraq once in passing, with reference to defence spending. Meanwhile, the Conservatives, bound to Iraq by their support for the war, didn't mention it once in their 131-page manifesto. How should Iraq be fitted in to our political history? The decision to support the US invasion was one of the defining foreign policy decisions of the past decade. It has cost us over £8bn and the blood of more than 500 soldiers killed and injured. Yet its lessons appear to have been confined only to the obscurity of inquiry rooms and half-hearted attempts to arrest Tony Blair. Britain shares responsibility for the situation in the ""new"" Iraq, so the issue cannot and should not be decoupled from the present and future of our politics. In terms of relations with the new Iraq, people would be right to question what influence and capability we have on the situation on the ground. Despite being the number-two partner to the occupation, Britain's influence in Iraq waned almost immediately after it became clear that the Pentagon was running the show. Subsequently, the British decision to withdraw from Basra by ""surge"" architect General Jack Keane as leaving a city of ""gangland warfare"", while relations with prime minister Nouri al-Maliki deteriorated when the British were seen to be reluctant to support his ""Charge of the Knights"" operation in Basra. Today, Britain has only a spartan presence in Iraq, helping to train the Iraqi navy in the Gulf. This, combined with the opaque and complex politics of the new Iraq, may lead some to argue that the British ability to make the weather in Iraq is at a post-invasion low. Nevertheless, responsibility persists and nowhere does responsibility and capability meet as in the issue of addressing Iraq's continued refugee crisis. in January this year, there are still more than 1.3 million Iraqi refugees living across the region, including some 747,910 in Syria and 500,000 in Jordan. Insight into their vulnerability is described by Debora Amos in her recent book, , including a detailed description of a typical night of an Iraqi refugee forced into prostitution in Damascus. Across the Atlantic, President Barack Obama got ""the politics of responsibility"" right. During his election campaign he promised $2bn to expand services available to Iraqi refugees and in last August Samantha Power (who during the election campaign famously described Hilary Clinton as a monster) as senior director for multilateral affairs and human rights, responsible for ""co-ordinating the efforts of the many parts of the US government on Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs)"". However, delivering on this has been delayed somewhat, especially now that the American administration has postponed ""until further notice"" the appointment of Robert Ford as ambassador to Damascus, following recent information about trucks bearing advanced weaponry that passed from Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Britain does have an ambassador in Damascus, yet sometimes appears to be heading in the opposite direction to that of the US. In October, the UNHCR expressed its concern over the British attempt to 44 Iraqi men to Baghdad. Here, responsibility towards Iraqi refugees clashes with the parties' policies towards immigration, an issue that both manifestos have plenty to say about - Labour promising that ""there will be no unskilled immigration from outside the EU"", while the Conservatives promise to ""take net migration back to the levels of the 1990s - tens of thousands a year, not hundreds of thousands"". So what hope for is there for a British foreign policy that is fair for all, or one where we're all in it together? To abandon those worst affected by a foreign policy failure is what the absence of Iraq from the party manifestos is committing ourselves towards."
116,BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-12-16,"Article discusses new ""openness"" in Jordanian-Iranian relations",,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"December 16, 2010",,"Text of report by Jordanian newspaper Al-Arab al-Yawm on 14 December [Article by Fahd al-Khitan: ""Jordan and Iran: Openness Necessitated by Interests.""] Differences between the two countries require dialogue rather than estrangement. Are we on the doors of a new phase in Jordanian-Iranian relations that will break the ice of previous years? The letter King Abdallah II received the day before yesterday from Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinezhad predicts a new development in relations between the two countries. The written message which was conveyed by Rahim Mashaei, head of Ahmadinezhad's office, does not appear to be an act of protocol. The statement issued by the Royal Court in the meeting clearly indicates that the letter is paving the way for steps to bring the two sides closer, which appeared evident in the invitation extended by the Iranian president to the king to visit Tehran, and his majesty's announcement of a ""summit meeting with the Iranian president to be held in Amman or Tehran."" Whether the king visits Tehran or Ahmadinezhad comes to Amman, this will represent a remarkable development in the relationship. On the bilateral level, Jordan has adopted a cautious policy towards Iran, and the rates of commercial trade and economic relations remained modest. Since the end of the tenure of the former Jordanian ambassador in Tehran, Jordan has not appointed a new ambassador thus far. In return, Tehran was keen to avoid diplomatic vacuum in Jordan and appointed a new ambassador in Amman months ago. He emphasized in a press interview with Al-Arab al-Yawm after assuming the position that he comes to give Iranian-Jordanian relations a strong push forward, based on direct instructions from the Iranian president. However, in parallel to the official wariness of relations with Iran, Jordan has taken a stance in opposition to any military act against it. The king has stated more than once that Jordan is opposed to military action and supports a diplomatic solution to the matter of Iran's nuclear file. Jordan has great reservations over Iran's politics and its role in Iraq. Moreover, it has harsh observations regarding its role in the Palestinian issue, and there is no doubt that Tehran also has positions regarding Jordan's policies, especially relations with Israel. The observer of international affairs cannot ignore Jordan's position in the file of Arab moderation and Iran's position in the file of opposition, along with Syria and other forces. However, the experience of alliances during the past few years has revealed that it is wrong to close doors, and that differences in political stances require openness and dialogue rather than estrangement. Moreover, in many cases, it is possible to neutralize political differences and develop bilateral relations in economic fields, and the current good relations between Jordan and Syria is the best example on the soundness of this option. Regardless of the position of western forces and Israel on Iran, Jordan is capable of opening communication channels with Tehran and expanding the margin of cooperation in many fields that would serve the interests of the two countries. It is certain that the policy of openness will contribute significantly to overcoming differences and bridging positions not only on the bilateral level, but also on the regional level. Iran is not Jordan's enemy, and the drums of war that Israel beats against Iran will bring about catastrophes for all the countries in the region. There is no reason for us to link relations with Iran to the western position on its nuclear file. Source: Al-Arab al-Yawm, Amman, in Arabic 14 Dec 10 p 3"

The embassy had given the wine to Theodoros Pangalos - MP for the socialist party PASOK and responsible also for co-ordination of the foreign policy and defense committee in the Greek government - as a gift for the Christmas holidays with the wishes of Israel's ambassador to Greece, Ali Yihiye. In a letter sent to the embassy with the returned wine, Pangalos said he was taught not to steal and not to accept products of theft. ""I have been taught since I was very young not to steal and not to accept products of theft,"" he wrote. ""So I cannot possibly accept this gift and I must return it back to you. ""As you know, your country occupies illegally the Golan Heights who belong to Syria, according to the international law and numerous decisions of the international community,"" Pangalos added. Referring to atrocities that occurred during the Second World War and the Balkan War, the socialist MP said: ""Actions such as those of these days of the Israel military in Gaza remind the Greek people of holocausts such as in Kalavrita or Doxato or Distomo and certainly in the ghetto of Warsaw."" While he called for an end to Hamas's terrorist activities, he compared Israel's action in Gaza to Nazi Germany's army. ""I take the opportunity to express my hope that Israel will find security into its internationally recognized borders and the terrorist activities against Israel territory by Hamas or anybody else will be contained and made impossible, but I also hope that your government will cease practicing the policy of collective punishment, which was applied on a mass scale by Hitler and his armies."""
118,The Jerusalem Post,2010-02-11,Tax-break bill for Golan residents splits Kadima MKs,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,NEWS; Pg. 3,"February 15, 2010",660 words,"Just when it seemed that Kadima was preparing for a unified rally against the expat voting bill, coalition MKs enlisted a previously unpublicized bill to prove on Wednesday how shaky opposition leader Tzipi Livni's hold on the party really is. Livni was forced to allow Kadima lawmakers to break with faction discipline during an early afternoon vote on MK Eli Aflalo's (Kadima) bill to offer tax discounts to residents of most Golan Heights communities. Livni and her allies announced on Tuesday that they opposed the bill, arguing that following recent tensions with Syria, any move to reassert the permanence of Israeli control of the Golan could needlessly heat up tensions further. But in a hearing on the measure in the House Committee on Wednesday, the coalition pushed to quickly advance the bill to its preliminary reading on the house floor. Kadima legislators argued that the decision was made after the Likud realized that a large number of Kadima MKs were signed onto Aflalo's bill, and that forcing a vote would force those MKs to vote either against their own bill or against their party leadership. With the bill set for its preliminary vote on Wednesday, the Kadima leadership tried to convince the government to delay the vote. When the coalition refused, Kadima attacked both Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak, accusing the government of ""miserable timing."" ""It would be expected that those who are responsible for Israel's foreign policy, and first and foremost those who talk of calming the current conditions, would put their political considerations in the appropriate position in their priorities and stop playing with fire at the expense of the State of Israel,"" slammed one Kadima official. But in advance of the vote, when it became clear that the Kadima lawmakers who were signed on the bill as co- sponsors planned on sticking to their guns - and their legislation - Kadima's leadership was forced to release its MKs from faction discipline. The vote passed, with the support of Netanyahu, as well as of Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz, by an overwhelming majority of 67 to 13, with one abstention. The Kadima MKs who voted in support of the bill included Robert Tibayev,ÊArieh Bibi, Ya'acov Edri, Ruhama Avraham-Balila, Marina Solodkin, Shaul Mofaz, Ze'ev Boim, Yulia Shamolov Berkovich and Meir Sheetrit. Aflalo's bill would not extend the proposed tax benefits to the four Druse communities in the northern Golan, which he said largely identify with Syria and demonstrate little desire to become part of Israeli society. ÊGolan residents who do not already enjoy tax benefits in their communities would benefit, as a result of the bill, by income tax reductions of up to 13%. Addressing the Knesset plenum immediately before the vote, Aflalo responded to hecklers asking if he had joined the Likud by reiterating that ""Kadima isn't a left-wing party. Get that out of your minds. Kadima is a centrist party and will remain a centrist party, and will continue as such."" In a conversation with The Jerusalem Post following the vote, Aflalo said that while he did not intend the bill to be used as a tool against his party chairwoman, the vote did show that ""there are still some real centrists in Kadima."" The Afula resident said he sponsored the legislation out of concern and appreciation for the residents of the Golan Heights, and that he hoped that one day he too could make his home there. Aflalo and Livni had a much-publicized falling-out last month, in which the veteran legislator submitted a request to be recognized as independent from the Knesset's largest faction. Aflalo's bill was not the only blow for Kadima on the Knesset floor Wednesday. Shortly after the vote, Kadima was forced once again to allow freedom from party discipline on another bill - a proposal by Meretz MK Nitzan Horowitz to reform the kashrut certification standards. On that bill, too, the party fractured along similar lines."
119,BBC Monitoring Europe - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-01-16,"Turkish paper says Turkish-Israeli ties ""gravely wounded""",,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"January 16, 2010",,"Text of report by Turkish newspaper Milliyet website on 15 January [Column by Fikret Bila: ""Turkish-Israeli Relations Are Gravely Wounded""] The disrespect with which Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon has treated Ambassador Oguz Celikkol will leave its marks on Turkish society - just like the hooding of Turkish soldiers by US forces in Al-Sulaymaniyah [Iraq]. After the latter incident, US military officials sent an apologetic letter to then Chief of the General Staff Hilmi Ozkok. Similarly, Israel apologized officially yesterday. However, such incidents remain in national memories for long periods even if apologies are offered. Just as anti-US sentiments surged in Turkey after the hooding incident, antipathy against Israel will grow in the aftermath of the ""low chair"" treatment accorded to our ambassador. Israel's mistake The state of Israel's relations with Arab countries needs no comment. Turkey has been the only regional country with which Israel has been able to maintain decent relations. Yet, Israel has made one mistake after another at a time when Ankara's influence in the region has been steadily growing and its relations with Arab countries has been improving. Israel began to lose Ankara's trust when it attacked Gaza even as Turkey was engaged in a quiet mediation effort with Syria - an effort that had produced significant progress - and only a few days after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was given assurances that there would be ""no military intervention."" Then came the crisis in Davos. It was a mistake for Israeli President Peres to turn to Prime Minister Erdogan and to speak to him in a scolding tone. The prime minister rightly responded very sharply to this posture and walked out of the panel. This disagreeable process resulted in the exclusion of Israeli planes from the Anatolian Eagle Exercises in Turkey. The decision was made by Prime Minister Erdogan and the Foreign Ministry to guard against the perception that pilots who had bombed Gaza would be training in Turkey. Ankara's decision to exclude Israel from the exercises was an important warning to Israel. Relations with Arab countries Even as Turkey's relations with Israel cooled rapidly, its ties to Arab countries grew much more cordial compared to the past. Ankara upgraded its relations with these countries, especially Syria and Iraq, to the highest levels. Scores of political and economic agreements were signed with their governments. Erdogan's popularity in Arab countries surged in the aftermath of his outburst in Davos. Instead of taking advantage of these new circumstances, Israel has confronted Turkey with unprecedented ferocity. It cannot gain from such a posture. Its attempts to turn its relations with Turkey into material for its domestic politics cannot produce any result other than isolating Israel in the region. The Israeli administration must realize that it will lose if it burns its bridges with Turkey. President Peres' attempts to reduce tensions in the aftermath of both crises signal that Israel can see this reality. Nor should Ankara make the mistakes Tel Aviv has made. It must not see relations with Israel as material for its domestic politics. It must not base its relations with Arab countries solely on its opposition to Israel or the common denominator of religion. As a country that is in accession talks with the EU, Turkey must serve as a model to the Arab world with its secular regime and its democracy. It must maintain balanced relations in the region to contribute to the establishment of peace in the Middle East. Turkish-Israeli relations There is no doubt that Turkish-Israeli relations are gravely wounded. The Israeli government is comprised of a fragile coalition, and this is making the normalization of relations more difficult. The latest scandal may be seen as a domestic-driven political action stemming from the weak structure of the coalition. The responsibility of healing the wounds in Turkish-Israeli relations is largely incumbent upon Tel Aviv. Source: Milliyet website, Istanbul, in Turkish 15 Jan 10"

121,San Jose Mercury News (California),2010-04-22,Hanson: Israel can't afford for U.S. to be neutral,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,NEWS; Opinion,"April 23, 2010",689 words,"Current U.S. relations with our once-staunch ally Israel are at their lowest ebb in the past 50 years. The Obama administration seems as angry at the building of Jewish apartments in Jerusalem as it is intent on reaching out to Iran and Syria, Israel's mortal enemies. President Barack Obama himself, according to reports, has serially snubbed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A new narrative abounds in Washington that Israel's intransigence with its Arab neighbors now even endangers U.S. troops stationed in the Middle East. Obama is pushing Netanyahu's Likud government to make concessions on several fronts, from supplying power and food to Gaza, to hastened departure from the West Bank. These tensions follow the Obama administration's new outreach to the Muslim world. Obama gave his first interview as president to the Middle East newspaper Al Arabiya, in which he politely chided past U.S. policy on the Middle East. In his June 2009 Cairo address, the president again sought to placate the Islamic world in part by wrongly claiming that Islamic learning had sparked the European Renaissance and Enlightenment. Lost in all this reset-button diplomacy is introspection on why past American presidents sought to support Israel in the first place. We seem to forget why no-nonsense Harry Truman, against worldwide opposition, ensured the original creation of the Jewish state or why more than 60 percent of Americans in most polls continue to side with Israel in its struggle to survive. In contrast, most of the rest of the world does the math and concludes Israel is a bad investment. It has no oil; its enemies possess nearly half the world's reserves. There is no downside in criticizing Israel, but censuring some of its radical Arab neighbors might prompt anything from an oil embargo to a terrorist response. There are about 7 million Israelis; the Muslim and Arab population in the Middle East numbers in the hundreds of millions. According to the academic cult of multiculturalism, it is fashionable to see pro-American, democratic and capitalist Israel as a symbol of a pernicious Western culture of oppression; its enemies are seen as underdog liberationists. No wonder that in the ongoing dispute, most of the world adds up the pluses and minuses and concludes that it is wiser to side with Israel's foes than to become its friend. But why, until now, has America always bucked the tide? The reason is not the so-called ""Jewish lobby"" here in the U.S., but because a clear majority of non-Jews supported Israel. They saw that in a sea of autocracy, Israel is a democracy and a free and open society. I suspect that when there is a final two-state settlement, Arabs wishing to remain inside Israel will be treated far more humanely as citizens than any Jews who stay on the West Bank and take their chances as residents of the new Palestinian state. We suspect that when Israel pulls back from lands occupied after the 1967 war, there will remain prominent calls in the Arab world to continue the withdrawal and finish Israel altogether. Holocaust denial is still a staple in intellectual circles of the Middle East, and serially embraced by the Iranian government. Fashionable anti-Israeli sentiment is de rigueur in European elite society. Nearly a third of all country-specific resolutions passed by United Nations Commission on Human Rights have damned Israel far more than anything directed at the mass-murdering regimes of Idi Amin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein or the Taliban. In contrast, America's traditional bipartisan support for Israel put the world on notice that the United States would never allow another Holocaust or the destruction of Israel, or even serial attacks against it. Yet if we are seen as neutral, just watch the rest of the world get the message and start piling on. Anti-Jewish terrorism will gear up again. Frontline entities like Hezbollah, Syria and Iran will ready their missiles without worry of American anger. Iran will assume we are resigned to its acquisition of the bomb.

122,The Washington Post,2010-03-04,U.S. strives to check Burma's military trade with N. Korea,Suburban Edition,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,FOREIGN; Pg. A13,"March 4, 2010",873 words,"The Obama administration, concerned that Burma is expanding its military relationship with North Korea, has launched an aggressive campaign to persuade Burma's junta to stop buying North Korean military technology, U.S. officials said. Concerns about the relationship -- which encompass the sale of small arms, missile components and technology possibly related to nuclear weapons -- in part prompted the Obama administration in October to end the George W. Bush-era policy of isolating the military junta, said a senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. Senior U.S. officials have since had four meetings with their Burmese counterparts, with a fifth expected soon. ""Our most decisive interactions have been around North Korea,"" the official said. ""We've been very clear to Burma. We'll see over time if it's been heard."" Congress and human rights organizations are increasingly criticizing and questioning the administration's new policy toward the Southeast Asian nation, which is also known as Myanmar. Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and generally a supporter of the administration's foreign policy, recently called for the administration to increase the pressure on Burma, including tightening sanctions on the regime. ""Recent events have raised the profile of humanitarian issues there,"" Berman said Friday. ""Support is growing for more action in addition to ongoing efforts."" Thus far, the engagement policy has not yielded any change in Burma's treatment of domestic opponents. On Friday, Burma's supreme court rejected opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's latest bid to end more than a decade of house arrest. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate's National League for Democracy won elections in 1990, but the military, which has ruled Burma since 1962, did not cede power. In recent months, the junta has also ramped up repression against political dissidents and ethnic groups, although it has released one aging dissident -- U Tin Oo -- after almost seven years in detention. Thousands of people have fled Burmese military assaults, escaping to China, Bangladesh and Thailand, in the months after the U.S. opening. A report issued this week by the Karen Women's Organization alleged that Burmese troops have gang-raped, killed and even crucified Karen women in an attempt to root out a 60-year-old insurgency by guerrillas from that ethnic minority. On Feb. 10, a Burmese court sentenced a naturalized Burmese American political activist from Montgomery County to three years of hard labor; he was allegedly beaten, denied food and water, and placed in isolation in a tiny cell with no toilet. Burma recently snubbed the United Nations' special envoy on human rights, TomÃ¡s Ojea Quintana, denying him a meeting with Suu Kyi and access to Burma's senior leadership. ""The bad behavior has increased,"" said Ernest Bower, an expert on Southeast Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Nevertheless, U.S. officials argue -- and Bower and others agree -- that talking with Burma remains the best way forward, especially given the concerns about its deepening military relationship with North Korea. It is also important to keep talking with Burma, said Sen. James Webb (D-Va.), because China is more than willing to replace U.S. influence in that country and throughout Southeast Asia. Webb's trip to Burma in August -- the first by a member of Congress in a decade -- has been credited with giving the Obama administration the political cover to open up talks with the junta. Underlining the administration's concerns about Burma is a desire to avoid a repeat of events that unfolded in Syria in 2007. North Korea is thought to have helped Syria secretly build a nuclear reactor there capable of producing plutonium. The facility was reportedly only weeks or months away from being functional when Israeli warplanes bombed it in September of that year. ""The lesson here is the Syrian one,"" said David Albright, president of the nongovernmental Institute for Science and International Security and an expert on nuclear proliferation. ""That was such a massive intelligence failure. You can't be sure that North Korea isn't doing it someplace else. The U.S. government can't afford to be blindsided again."" Burma is thought to have started a military relationship with North Korea in 2007. But with the passage of a U.N. Security Council resolution last June banning all weapons exports from North Korea, Burma has emerged ""as a much bigger player than it was,"" the senior U.S. official said. In a report Albright co-wrote in January, titled ""Burma: A Nuclear Wannabe,"" he outlined the case for concern about Burma's relations with North Korea. First, Burma has signed a deal with Russia for the supply of a 10-megawatt thermal research reactor, although construction of the facility had not started as of September. Second, although many claims from dissident groups about covert nuclear sites in Burma are still unverified, the report said that ""there remain legitimate reasons to suspect the existence of undeclared nuclear activities in Burma, particularly in the context of North Korean cooperation."""
123,The Washington Post,2010-11-04,The degree of difficulty rises for Obama agenda,Regional Edition,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,A-SECTION; Pg. A28,"November 4, 2010",843 words,"The midterm elections focused almost exclusively on domestic issues. But Tuesday's outcome may complicate President Obama's foreign-policy goals, with Republicans using their new strength to cut aid to other countries and question the president's policies toward countries such as Syria, Venezuela and Israel, officials and analysts said. The Republican capture of the House means that Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.), a feisty Cuban American conservative, will probably take command of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, replacing Howard L. Berman (D-Calif), who had been largely sympathetic to Obama's agenda. Ros-Lehtinen is expected to ""bring additional scrutiny to some issues that wasn't taking place before,"" said one GOP congressional aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the congresswoman has not yet been formally appointed. Ros-Lehtinen is a strong supporter of Israel. She is likely to grill administration officials on their policies toward North Korea and Syria and to focus attention on the influence of leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Latin America. The Florida Republican also has been a strong proponent of withholding contributions from the United Nations to force reform of that organization. Although the Senate stayed in Democratic hands, it will probably be even harder for President Obama to win ratification of treaties, a process that requires 67 votes. The White House is hoping the Senate will use the lame-duck session to approve one of Obama's main foreign-policy accomplishments, a nuclear arms-reduction treaty with Russia. Democrats will control at least 58 seats until January, when the number could drop as low as 52. Administration officials acknowledge that it will be harder to pass START if the vote slips to next year. But they are banking on striking a deal with Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz), who has influence with many Republicans. Kyl's main demand has been guarantees for a multibillion-dollar program to modernize American nuclear-weapons labs. ""If we're able to satisfy those [concerns], which we're working to do, that opens a pathway forward, whether it's with this set of Republicans or the next,"" said one senior U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly. The biggest losers in the midterm elections were moderate Democrats who were the staunchest backers of the adminstration's Afghanistan policy. Their defeat will yield a Democratic caucus that is significantly more antiwar. The Obama administration will, in turn, probably be forced to depend more heavily on Republicans, who have generally backed the overall strategy in Afghanistan. ""The level of inconvenience may go up for the Obama administration, but I don't think it will be likely to force a policy change,"" said Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. If the Afghan war is still widely viewed as going poorly next year, though, it is possible that some conservative Republicans could break with their party. ""There is a libertarian streak that is starting to emerge in the Republican party . . . that has called for significant reductions in defense spending,"" said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a defense think tank. The Democratic party losses, however, could have a much bigger impact on Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates's push to pare waste from the defense budget. Several moderate Democrats who were respected voices on defense policy, such as Rep. Ike Skelton (Mo.) and Rep. John M. Spratt (S.C.), lost their seats Tuesday. Their support probably would have given Gates's efficiency efforts a major boost inside the Democratic Party. The uncertain political environment will also make it harder for new lawmakers from either party to support cuts to the defense budget that could cost jobs, analysts said. Lee Hamilton, the former congressman who now heads the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said Obama might have an easier time getting funding for the war in Afghanistan from a Congress in which Republicans were more dominant. But ""funding for foreign affairs in general, the State Department, development aid, will probably be tighter,"" he said. Rep. Kay Granger (R-Texas), who is known for her bipartisan efforts, is expected to become the head of the Appropriations panel that doles out foreign aid. But when it comes to spending, ""you're going to have a lot of orders coming down from a higher pay grade"" in the party, said one congressional staffer, who was not authorized to speak on the record. Several analysts said the Republican victories would bode well for passage of pending free-trade treaties with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. But Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said the conventional wisdom could be wrong in this case. ""It's not clear that will be the case, given that some of the Republicans who won are not traditionalists and also because of the economic context - the high unemployment and slow growth,"" he said. sheridanm@washpost.com jaffeg@washpost.com"

Mike Godwin held in 1990 that the longer a discussion continues on the web the greater the likelihood that some fool invoking the Nazis would reduce it to absurdity. Today, reduction to Zionism has replaced reductio ad Hitlerum. It is impossible for discussions of Middle Eastern dictatorship, the rise of psychopathic Islamism or the alienation of immigrant Muslim communities in the west to continue without participants maintaining that Jewish influence is ""the root cause"" of the evils to hand. From the far left to the Liberal Democrats, alleged progressives have Jews on the brain. The point to make against them is not that there are worse countries than Israel, which receive nothing like the same level of opprobrium - even though there are and they most certainly do not - but that Israel's critics ignore the uses of racism and forget the lessons of the 20th century. The leaders of Ba'athist Syria or theocratic Iran or monarchical Saudi Arabia do not faithfully reproduce the fantasies of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion solely because they hate Jews. They need a conspiracy theory to divert the attention of their subject populations from the failures of their rule as badly as the tsars did in the 1900s and the Nazis in the 1930s. Then, as now, the ability to brand political opponents as Zionist fifth columnists and liberal principles as decadent Jewish ruses that divert the faithful from fulfilling their religious or racial destiny are essential aids to the maintenance of their power. Hamas, around which the disputes about aid to Gaza rage, is a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, which fused fascist and radical Islamist ideas during the German push into the Middle East during the Second World War.

As with the European reactionaries of the 20th century, Islamists do not stop with Jew hatred. Advances for radical Islam are always disasters for women, homosexuals, democrats, socialists and free thinkers. Put like this, the behaviour of European liberals seems more reprehensible than ever. Instead of confronting or even arguing with the anti-liberal forces that are terrorising much of the Middle East and Asia, they appease them and offer them Israel as a placatory gesture, when Israel is not theirs to give away. The refusal to understand what antisemitism is and what antisemites want to do to Jews and non-Jews alike makes sense as a general explanation for attitudes towards Israel. It is, however, a measure of the political failure of the Netanyahu government that it no longer suffices as a particular explanation for the bias of the Gaza debate. I have no wish to lay myself open to unwarranted accusations of even-handedness, but knowing where to begin with a defence of Israel or any other cause also involves knowing when to stop. The true measure of the disastrous consequences of the Gaza blockade for all sides is the unwillingness of Palestinians who have most to fear from Islamism to condemn Hamas. I spoke to Mustafa Barghouti from the Palestinian National Initiative last week. He is secular, leftwing and a believer in the two-state solution and non-violent protest. In other words, he is everything a supporter of sane politics and sensible compromises could want him to be. Yet he could not bring himself to say a word against Hamas while more than one million of his fellow countrymen and women were confined in Gaza. His sole priority was national unity until the blockade was over. Everything else was a distraction. He may be being a fool - the graveyards of the Middle East are filled with Arab and Iranian leftists who thought they could safely form alliances of convenience with clerical reaction - but he is not being disingenuous. ""Whataboutery"" is always a disreputable way of distracting attention. Those who look at Gaza and say: ""But what about Syria, Iran or Kurdistan?"" are as bad as those who looked at Saddam's Iraq and said: ""But what about Burma, Congo or North Korea?"" At least Barghouti concentrates on the issue at hand: the lack of basic humanitarian supplies, including foods and medicine, and the mass unemployment and restrictions on movement Gazans have suffered for five years, and will continue to suffer unless Israel or Hamas change course. Israelis do not see why they should blink first. Their belief that they are on the receiving end of a hypocritical campaign sustains their siege mentality and nurtures the fear that if Israel pulls back from Gaza's borders, Hamas will grow in strength and arm itself with Iranian missiles. Israelis are not being irrational. The same fears persuade the Egyptian government to blockade Gaza from the south, although we rarely hear about that. But the way to handle hypocrites is not to say as Israelis do that ""the world will condemn us whatever policy we follow"" but to call their bluff. If Israel were to relax the import restrictions and Hamas were to rearm, reasonable opinion, including reasonable Palestinian opinion, would see it for what it would be: a declaration of war. As things stand, reasonable opinion, including reasonable Palestinian opinion, is merging with the opinions of every variety of conspiracy nut and Jew-baiter. Leaving all humanitarian arguments to one side, no Israeli government should tolerate that."

This truth was brought home by a recent report titled A Third Lebanon War, issued by the influential Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). The author of the report, former Ambassador to Egypt and Israel, Dan Kurtzer, after methodically assessing factors on all sides, advises the US policymakers to prepare for the possibility of war in the next 12 to 18 months between Israel and Hizbollah forces in Lebanon. (Kurtzer wrote his piece well before the rumours that an international tribunal may be indicting members of Hizbollah for the assassination of Rafiq Hariri. And while this has generated a new set of concerns with the focus now on Lebanon's internal stability instead of war with Israel, the CFR piece remains useful for its analysis and the dangers it examines.) The developments that prompt Kurtzer's assessment are twofold: Israel's growing concerns with the quantity and quality of weapons alleged to have been amassed by Hizbollah in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, and the heightened war-like rhetoric on both sides. Kurtzer sees it as unlikely that Hizbollah would launch hostilities, and suggests that the more likely scenarios are that Israel would either try to lure the Lebanese militia into a war or take it upon itself to attack Hizbollah positions in Lebanon in an effort to ""degrade"" the group's military ""capabilities"". Kurtzer cautions that no good would come of this renewed conflict. Lebanon would again pay a bitter price. Israel, already experiencing some degree of international isolation, would see its standing further compromised and such an adventure would most likely not result in dislodging or weakening Hizbollah. And the US would witness severe setbacks to its three major policy objectives in the Middle East: ""slowing or stopping Iran's nuclear programme, withdrawing combat forces from Iraq, and helping Middle East peace talks succeed."" While Kurtzer suggests measures that the US might take to discourage an Israeli attack or, after hostilities begin, to limit them, he acknowledges that the combination of partisan politics and the work of the Israel lobby would likely restrain the administration from taking too aggressive a stance to pressure Israel or more actively engage Iran and Syria, or to open a dialogue with Hizbollah: all with an eye toward easing regional tensions. In the end, Kurtzer concludes that while the US ""should work to avert another war in Lebanon, its capacity to do so is limited."" He, therefore, concludes that the administration's best options are to prepare for a worst case scenario. Among these options are ""upgrading US intelligence collection and US-Israeli intelligence cooperation""; ""publicly restate US support for Israel's right to self-defence and concerns about Hizbollah's rearmament""; ""increase diplomatic pressure on Syria""; and ""prepare for possible postwar diplomatic initiatives."" After reading the CFR report, several questions came to mind, focusing on the dangerous illusions that appear to guide behaviour of all involved in this bizarre ""dance of death"". If no good will come of a third Lebanon war, as Kurtzer rightly notes, then why are we, once again, at the brink of conflict? At what point will Israel's military planners realise that one more war will bring them no closer to regional peace and acceptance than any of the past wars? If Hizbollah is truly concerned with the rights, safety, security and prosperity of its people, then why does it persist in this dangerous game of rearming and brinkmanship? If the US has so much to lose, then why will it allow partisan politics and a lobby to limit its ability to protect its national interests by actively working to restrain one bully or opening a dialogue with another? Can Dan Kurtzer, whose thoughtful and disturbing analysis has so correctly identified the costs, futility and dangers of renewed conflict, really believe that the recommendations he proposes at the end will do anything but encourage the war planners to proceed on their fools' errand? And can anyone really believe that at the end of yet another devastating round of hostilities the region will be anymore receptive to a productive ""diplomatic initiative"" than it has been after past conflicts or it is today? That another war will create peace; that more arms that only provoke your dangerous better-armed and unrestrained neighbour will make you secure; that bad policy made under the duress of domestic politics will produce anything other than bad results: these are the dangerous illusions under which all have been labouring for decades, and apparently still are.

Some of these cables originate from the US Embassy in Cairo, of which some are ostensibly penned by Scobey herself. They include details on meetings with top Egyptian officials, including President Hosni Mubarak and intelligence chief Omar Suleiman, who expound on a wide array of regional issues. Choice pickings from the dispatches include Scobeys alleged description of Mubaraks hatred to Hamas, and visceral hatred for Iran, whom he described as big fat liars. There is also a scene setter penned for US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton ahead of a meeting with Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit who was described as unwilling to discuss Egyptian failings. In a press statement, Scobey said, Whatever WikiLeaks motives are in publishing these documents, releasing them poses real risks to real people. We deeply regret the disclosure of information that was intended to be confidential. And we condemn it. Whatever controversy the purported diplomatic reports may cause, it is important to be clear that such reports do not represent a governments final determination of official foreign policy. In the United States, they are just one of many elements that shape our policies, which are ultimately set by the President and the Secretary of State. When contacted by Daily News Egypt Tuesday, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry declined to comment and said that no statement had been released on the matter. The ministry also did not state when or whether there would be a response. Clinton had responded on Monday to the leak, which has caused worldwide embarrassment for the US as it includes personal impressions of numerous foreign officials as well as quotes of their opinions on other nations. Our policy is a matter of public record, as reflected in our statements and our actions around the world, she said, So I think that this is well-understood in the diplomatic community as part of the give-and-take. And I would hope that we will be able to move beyond this and back to the business of working together on behalf of our common goals. A dispatch with Scobeys name written at the bottom described a meeting between a Congressional Delegation headed by Representative Brian Baird with Mubarak, Suleiman and head of the policies committee of the National Democratic Party Gamal Mubarak on the margins of 2008s World Economic Forum in Sharm El-Sheikh. The meeting took place on May 20 and Gamal Mubaraks capacity for being there was described in the cable as the presidential son. In this dispatch, President Mubarak allegedly advised the US that the way forward in Iraq was a dictatorship, as the Iraqi people were not suited for democracy. He said, Strengthen the armed forces, relax your hold, and then you will have a coup. Then we will have a dictator, but a fair one. Forget democracy, the Iraqis are by their nature too tough. Again, Egyptian fears of Iranian influence in the region are apparent in the cable as Suleiman highlights their involvement in Iraq, Lebanon, the Gaza Strip and with Shia communities in the Gulf countries. In the dispatch, Suleiman also bemoans the sometimes obstinate stance the US takes towards Egypt stating, Your unilateral positions on economic aid are very difficult but insists that Egypt wants to continue having a very close relationship with the US. As for Gamal, whose presence in this meeting seems opaque, as he holds no executive post especially as he is quoted on regional issues, he tells the Congressional Delegation: The battle lines are clearer for Egypt than ever before on issues pertaining to the Middle East. Asked by a US delegate his opinion of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, Gamal responds, He understand the world better than his father but was wary of opening Syria up politically or economically for fear of losing control. Gamal Mubarak also discusses border issues regarding Egypt and Gaza, stating that the smuggling occurring in tunnels beneath the border was a shared concern Egypt recruits agents to counter Iran Another cable shows that Suleiman also told US top military commander Admiral Michael Mullen in a 2009 meeting that Iran had tried to recruit Bedouins to smuggle weapons into Hamas-controlled Gaza and that Egyptian security had rounded up a cell of Lebanons Iranian-backed Hezbollah, AFP reported. Iran must pay the price for its actions and not be allowed to interfere in regional affairs, the US Cairo embassy cable dated April 30, 2009, quoted Suleiman as telling Mullen. If you want Egypt to cooperate with you on Iran, we will ... it would take a big burden off our shoulders, Suleiman is quoted as saying in the cable. AFP reported that the intelligence chief also told Mullen: Egypt has started a confrontation with Hezbollah and Iran ... [and] if they interfere in Egypt, Egypt will interfere in Iran, the cable said. Suleiman reportedly added that the Egyptian General Intelligence Service had already begun recruiting agents in Iraq and Syria. In a separate cable on a meeting with General David Petraeus, later in 2009, Suleiman accused Iran of supporting the opposition Muslim Brotherhood and the militant Gamaa Islamiya group. Suleiman stressed that Egypt suffers from Iranian interference, through its Hezbollah and Hamas proxies, and its support for Egyptian groups like the Gamaa and the Brotherhood, said the cable dated July 14. He told Petraeus, however, that Iran had heeded Egypts warning to stop interfering in the country.Additional reporting by AFP. 129 of 266 DOCUMENTS Cape Argus (South Africa) November 06, 2010 Saturday E1 Edition New lawmakers could knock president's foreign policy goals Greg Jaffe|and Mary Beth Sheridan But Tuesday's outcome may complicate President Barack Obama's foreign-policy goals, with Republicans using their new strength to cut aid to other countries and question the president's policies toward countries such as Syria, Venezuela and Israel, officials and analysts said. The Republican capture of the House means that Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a feisty Cuban American conservative, will probably take command of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, replacing Democrat Howard Berman, who had been largely sympathetic to Obama's agenda. Ros-Lehtinen is a strong supporter of Israel. She is likely to grill administration officials on their policies toward North Korea and Syria and to focus attention on the influence of leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Latin America. She also has been a strong proponent of withholding contributions from the UN to force change in that organisation. Although the Senate stayed in Democratic hands, it will probably be even harder for Obama to win ratification of treaties, a process that requires 67 votes. The White House is hoping the Senate will use the lame-duck session to approve one of Obama's main foreign-policy accomplishments, a nuclear arms-reduction treaty with Russia. Administration officials are banking on a deal with Republican Senator Jon Kyl, whose main demand has been guarantees for a multibillion-dollar programme to modernise US nuclear weapons labs. The biggest losers in the mid-term elections were moderate Democrats who were the staunchest backers of the administration's Afghanistan policy. Their defeat will yield a Democratic caucus that is significantly more anti-war. The Obama administration will, in turn, probably be forced to depend more heavily on Republicans, who have generally backed the overall strategy in Afghanistan. If the Afghan war is still widely viewed as going poorly next year, though, it is possible that some conservative Republicans could break with their party. ""There is a libertarian streak that is starting to emerge in the Republican partyâ[#x20ac]¦ that has called for significant reductions in defence spending,"" an analyst said. The uncertain political environment will also make it harder for new lawmakers from either party to support cuts to the defence budget that could cost jobs, analysts said. Lee Hamilton, the former congressman who now heads the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars, said Obama might have an easier time getting funding for the war in Afghanistan from a Congress in which Republicans were more dominant. But ""funding for foreign affairs in general, the State Department, development aid, will probably be tighter"", he said. - The Washington Post"
130,The New York Times,2010-02-16,U.S. Engagement With Iran Shifts to Worldview,Late Edition - Final,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; NEWS ANALYSIS; Pg. 8,"May 26, 2010",1120 words,"For two days this month, Gen. James L. Jones, President Obama's national security adviser, and Manouchehr Mottaki, the Iranian foreign minister, were in the same place at the same time, attending a high-level security conference in Munich with a number of high-ranking officials from around the world. And yet the two made no plans to meet with each other. Whatever happened to engagement? As a presidential candidate, Mr. Obama declared himself open to dialogue even with intransigent states like Iran. But there is little diplomatic nicety to be seen these days, as the administration presses tough new sanctions aimed at the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in Iran, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton warned Monday of a drift toward a military dictatorship. White House officials maintain that they have not abandoned Mr. Obama's pledge of engagement, and point to the numerous times in the past year that he reached out to Iran, including a YouTube video to the Iranian people; a letter from Mr. Obama to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; and even an offer to help Iran buy isotopes for a medical research reactor. But the nonencounter in Munich between General Jones and Mr. Mottaki, like the full court press on Iran by Mrs. Clinton and other envoys to the region this week, shows that the administration is coming to terms with the limits of its engagement policy, many foreign policy experts say. Ray Takeyh, a former Iran adviser to the Obama administration, said administration officials were learning from experience. ''There was a thesis a year ago that the differences between the United States and Iran was subject to diplomatic mediation, that they could find areas of common experience, that we were ready to have a dialogue with each other,'' Mr. Takeyh said, but ''those anticipations discounted the extent how the Iranian theocracy views engagement with the United States as a threat to its ideological identity.'' And if Mrs. Clinton is correct that the Revolutionary Guards, not the politicians or the clerics, are becoming the central power in Iran, the prospects for rapprochement can only look worse. Not that Iran's political and religious leaders, so far, have demonstrated much interest in Mr. Obama's outreach. Instead, administration officials say, the biggest benefit of Mr. Obama's engagement policy now is not dialogue or understanding with adversaries, but simply a defusing of a worldwide view that the United States is part of the problem, a demonstration that the problem is Tehran's intransigence, not Washington's pique. ''What the president has achieved is that he has outed Iran,'' a senior administration official said Friday. He said Iran, by refusing to respond positively, had exposed itself as uninterested in a better relationship with the United States. That is now the central point of the new White House outlook on engagement, and it extends, administration officials say, to Venezuela, North Korea and Cuba as well. Mr. Obama, for instance, was criticized for shaking hands with Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, at a summit meeting in Trinidad and Tobago last year, but White House officials say that gesture has helped with Latin American views of Mr. Chavez's anti-American rhetoric. In the months ahead, administration officials hope they will benefit from a global perception that Mr. Obama has reached out to North Korea, Cuba and even Syria. The United States is on the verge of returning an ambassador to Syria five years after the American ambassador was recalled to protest Syria's suspected involvement in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri of Lebanon. While Washington and Damascus are still far apart on issues like the Arab-Israeli peace process and militant Islamic groups like Hezbollah, administration officials say they are hoping for a warming relationship. In the case of Cuba, progress has been slower. While Washington and Havana have had some talks on migration issues, and Cuba allowed American medical flights from Haiti to pass through Cuban airspace, there is no sign yet of any real thaw. But there, again, White House officials insist that at least Mr. Obama has not given Cuban leaders the opportunity to hold up the United States as a convenient target. But Iran is where the administration is pinning most of its hopes about the perception of American engagement. At a news briefing on Thursday, the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, presented this latest metamorphosis of the administration's thinking: that engagement is not necessarily about the two adversaries, but rather, about the worldview on America. The White House, he said, is trying to get Russia and China to join the United States, Britain, France and Germany -- a group referred to in diplomatic circles as the P5+1, for the permanent five members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany -- in imposing harsher sanctions against Iran for its pursuit of a nuclear program. While it remains unclear whether the effort will succeed, Mr. Gibbs said Mr. Obama's outreach to Iran had paved the way for a united Security Council resolution. ''We would not be here unified in the P5+1 were it not for engagement,'' Mr. Gibbs said. ''Because we engaged, it demonstrated to the world that the choices that Iran made were choices that it alone had to vouch for.'' That is a far cry from the argument Mr. Obama has made in the past about why American and Iranian leaders needed to talk. In his speech to the Muslim world from Cairo last June, Mr. Obama spoke of the need for both nations to overcome decades of mistrust. ''There will be many issues to discuss between our two countries, and we are willing to move forward without preconditions on the basis of mutual respect,'' he said. Mr. Obama even acknowledged that the role the United States played in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government in 1953 was a source of some of the tension, then added that ''rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward.'' But that was before the Iranian government's crackdown on protesters disputing the presidential election last June, and before Iran refused to fully sign on to an agreement to ship the country's low-enriched uranium to a third country for further processing. After those events, Mr. Obama has sounded increasingly clear about the limits of engagement. Last Tuesday, he said he had ''bent over backwards to say to the Islamic Republic of Iran that we are willing to have a constructive conversation'' about issues between the two countries. ''They have made their choice so far.''"

Cohen had spent the day in transit from D.C.; Ross hadn't eaten anything besides a morning muffin. Yet they were in the mood to share, and dinner could wait. It wasn't every day they got to tweet about visiting the headquarters of Twitter. ''Exactly 140 characters,'' Cohen said. ''What a ninja you are,'' Ross said. They looked at each other, thumbs poised above their BlackBerries. ''Whenever we do this, we get called out on it,'' Cohen said. They did it anyway, in unison. ''Three . . . two . . . one. . . .'' Tweet. Upward of 500,000 people instantly learned that the Twitterers had been to Twitter. On Twitter, Cohen, who is 28, and Ross, who is 38, are among the most followed of anyone working for the U.S. government, coming in third and fourth after Barack Obama and John McCain. This didn't happen by chance. Their Twitter posts have become an integral part of a new State Department effort to bring diplomacy into the digital age, by using widely available technologies to reach out to citizens, companies and other nonstate actors. Ross and Cohen's style of engagement -- perhaps best described as a cross between social-networking culture and foreign-policy arcana -- reflects the hybrid nature of this approach. Two of Cohen's recent posts were, in order: ''Guinea holds first free election since 1958'' and ''Yes, the season premier [sic] of Entourage is tonight, soooo excited!'' This offhand mix of pop and politics has on occasion raised eyebrows and a few hackles (writing about a frappucino during a rare diplomatic mission to Syria; a trip with Ashton Kutcher to Russia in February), yet, together, Ross and Cohen have formed an unlikely and unprecedented team in the State Department. They are the public face of a cause with an important-sounding name: 21st-century statecraft. To hear Ross and Cohen tell it, even last year, in this age of rampant peer-to-peer connectivity, the State Department was still boxed into the world of communiques, diplomatic cables and slow government-to-government negotiations, what Ross likes to call ''white guys with white shirts and red ties talking to other white guys with white shirts and red ties, with flags in the background, determining the relationships.'' And then Hillary Clinton arrived. ''The secretary is the one who unleashed us,'' Ross says. ''She's the godmother of 21st-century statecraft.'' Traditional forms of diplomacy still dominate, but 21st-century statecraft is not mere corporate rebranding -- swapping tweets for broadcasts. It represents a shift in form and in strategy -- a way to amplify traditional diplomatic efforts, develop tech-based policy solutions and encourage cyberactivism. Diplomacy may now include such open-ended efforts as the short-message-service (S.M.S.) social-networking program the State Department set up in Pakistan last fall. ''A lot of the 21st-century dynamics are less about, Do you comport politically along traditional liberal-conservative ideological lines?'' Ross says. ''Today it is -- at least in the spaces we engage in -- Is it open or is it closed?'' Early this year, Ross and Cohen helped prop open the State Department's doors by bringing 10 leading figures of the tech and social-media worlds to Washington for a private dinner with Clinton and her senior staff. Among the guests were Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google; Jack Dorsey, co-founder and chairman of Twitter; James Eberhard of Mobile Accord; Shervin Pishevar of the mobile-phone-game-development company SGN; Jason Liebman of Howcast; Tiffany Shlain, founder of the Webby Awards; and Andrew Rasiej of Personal Democracy Forum, an annual conference on the intersection of politics and technology. Toward the end of the evening, Clinton delighted those assembled by inviting them to use her ''as an app.'' A few days later, they did. On Jan. 12, the Haiti earthquake struck, and within two hours, Eberhard, working with the State Department, set up the Text Haiti 90999 program, which raised more than $40 million for the Red Cross in $10 donations. Jan. 12 was significant for supporters of 21st-century statecraft for another reason. It was also the day Google announced that Chinese hackers tried to break into the Gmail accounts of dissidents. In response, Google said that it would no longer comply with China's censorship laws and for a few months redirected Chinese users to its Hong Kong search engine. The dispute rose to a high-level diplomatic conflict, but it also gave added resonance to the 45-minute ''Internet freedom'' speech Secretary Clinton delivered a little more than a week later, in which she placed ''the freedom to connect'' squarely within the U.S. human rights and foreign policy agenda. Within weeks, Ross and Cohen found themselves dining in San Francisco on the eve of a State-sponsored diplomatic mission to Silicon Valley. ''Dude, tomorrow is going to be awesome,'' Ross said. AT THE GOOGLEPLEX, in Mountain View, the next day, Ross and Cohen took the director chairs next to Schmidt, the C.E.O., for one of Google's ''fireside chats.'' Dozens of Google employees were seated in the room, most with laptops open, while Schmidt quizzed the two in a slightly impish tone about their new methods (''Is it like calling up all the ambassadors and saying, Please use Facebook, Twitter and Google?'') and appreciatively referenced the Internet-freedom speech (''The Chinese are not so happy with me right now,'' Ross said, ''but they're madder at you''). At Google, and later at YouTube's headquarters, Ross and Cohen stressed the political power of viral videos and the potential for mobile phones to become widespread public tools for education, banking and election monitoring (an idea borrowed from Sierra Leone and Montenegro, where volunteers used S.M.S. to report on voting irregularities). It is fair to say that Ross and Cohen are obsessed with mobile phones; they speak at length about telemedicine, tele-education and something called telejustice (the details of which they haven't quite worked out yet). At an early-morning meeting in Palo Alto with mobile-banking experts, they looked for ways to expand a successful pilot program used to pay policemen via mobile phones in Afghanistan to another conflict zone in Congo. In both cases, as truckloads or planeloads of cash meant to pay policemen dwindled on their way from the capital cities to the provinces, so did the chances for lawful governance. Mobile banking is well established in places like Kenya, and cellphones are ubiquitous worldwide, even in poorly developed regions. Here was a way to use technology to address diplomacy, development and security concerns at once: direct payments to officers' phones, which would be transferable to the phones of their distant families, could become a powerful tool for stability, even in Congo. Or at least that was the hope. After the fireside chat, Schmidt sat in on a meeting with Google.org (the company's nonprofit arm) in which Ross and Cohen described the difficulty U.S. embassies have in keeping track of services and resources in countries where the U.S. hopes to spur development -- tracking, for example, nongovernmental organizations in Kenya. ''It would be fascinating to transform one of our embassies,'' Cohen said, ''and see if we can create a virtual aspect to make it a one-stop shop for everything that's out there.'' ''NGOs keep asking for a way to be able to understand, in a country like Kenya, who's doing clean water, who's doing education,'' one Google employee said. Several engineers chirped back and forth about the virtues of user-generated feedback and the challenges of multilayer mapping technology, until Schmidt cut them off. ''We have a big operation in Kenya,'' Schmidt said. ''We have the smartest guy in the country working for us. Why can't we just do this?'' This new marriage of Silicon Valley and the State Department can, at times, seem almost giddy in its tech evangelism. While it's hard to argue with the merits of helping nongovernmental organizations communicate with one another, there's a danger that close collaboration between the government and the tech world will be read as favoritism or quid pro quo. Anne-Marie Slaughter, director of the policy planning staff, acknowledged as much: ''So Google sits here, and Microsoft and Twitter and Facebook, but for all those household names, there are others -- and what are the guidelines to make sure that you're being evenhanded, as government has to be? We're just at the outset. Those are issues that are important but can be dealt with -- we're going to have to deal with them.'' AS MUCH AS Ross and Cohen extol the benefits of mobile banking and Silicon Valley partnerships, they admit that not every problem is best addressed with an app. Clinton, Ross assured me, ''doesn't believe you can sprinkle the Internet on something and everybody grows up to be healthy, wealthy and wise.'' As the recent Wikileaks scandal suggests, new technologies may usher in as many diplomatic catastrophes as breakthroughs. (In June, a former U.S. Army intelligence analyst claimed to have given 260,000 diplomatic cables to Wikileaks, a Web site dedicated to publishing confidential material.) When I asked Cohen whether sites like Wikileaks made the kind of diplomacy he advocates harder, he allowed that they posed a challenge: ''All of these tools can be utilized by individuals for everything from Wikileaks to other negative purposes'' -- at least as the State Department sees it -- ''but that technology isn't going anywhere. So we can fear we can't control it and ignore the space, or we can recognize we can't control it, but we can influence it.'' A series of events last year helped Ross and Cohen's work gain traction by showing that connection technologies have become inextricably entwined with the challenges of foreign policy. In April 2009, there was the so-called Twitter revolution in Moldova. In July 2009, there was China's regional-information blockade, including a total shutdown of the Internet, following the Uighur uprisings (''full'' Internet usage was restored to Xinjiang 10 months later). And then, of course, Iran, beginning in June 2009, when the organizing power of cellphones and social media -- and their ability to capture and disseminate images like the death of a young Iranian woman, Neda Agha-Soltan -- arrested the world's attention. (On the visit to YouTube in February, Cohen described the Neda video as ''the most significant viral video of our lifetimes'' and told the site's senior management that YouTube is in some ways ''better than any intelligence we could get, because it's generated by users in Iran.'') Most of the news that reached the West from Iran came via YouTube and Twitter. In June of last year, three days into the postelection protests, a Twitter post by the opposition candidate Mir Hussein Moussavi alerted Cohen that Twitter was scheduled to go down for maintenance. Cohen sent an e-mail message to Dorsey, the site's 33-year-old chairman, without running it up the chain of command. Dorsey went to work -- ''I was definitely raising my voice'' trying to find a way for the service to stay up, Dorsey told me. The New York Times broke the story of Cohen's e-mail message. A flurry of public speculation ensued as to whether keeping Twitter up contradicted the president's stated policy of nonintervention in the Iranian election. The same debate was under way among the secretary's senior staff. ''There's no precedent for what it meant to keep a social-media network up in a postelection environment,'' Ross told me later. ''There's no casework. There's no legal statecraft precedent for such things.'' Secretary Clinton's decision not to condemn Cohen's actions was an example of her willingness to ''ride the wave,'' Slaughter told me. ''Things were happening very fast; the stakes were very high. We didn't put out propaganda to try to influence what was going on there. We simply made it possible for people to continue communicating. ''We weren't set up to think about what we would do in that situation,'' Slaughter went on. ''Now we would be.'' The State Department recently cut financing for some activist groups based outside Iran that promote democracy and began to focus on providing information technologies that would facilitate communication among dissidents in Iran. Restrictions imposed by U.S. sanctions were lifted to allow for the export of instant-messaging and antifiltering software. But it's not clear how easy it will be for companies to enable Iranians to download applications while keeping government censors at bay; even if they can, not everyone agrees that Twitter's revolutionary power has lived up to the hype. Evgeny Morozov, an academic at Georgetown and perhaps the fiercest critic of this brand of diplomacy, published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal in February, charging that the State Department has been all too willing to sweep the dangers of Twitter diplomacy under the rug. ''Facebook and Twitter empower all groups -- not just the pro-Western groups that we like,'' he wrote, pointing out that the Iranian government was also active online: ''Not only did it thwart Internet communications, the government (or its plentiful loyalists) also flooded Iranian Web sites with videos of dubious authenticity . . . that aimed to provoke and splinter the opposition.'' (The Iranian government later used Facebook to track Iranian dissidents around the world.) When I brought up the op-ed, Cohen dismissed Morozov's complaint. ''The problem with his thinking,'' he said, ''is it neglects the inevitability that this technology is going to spread -- so he advocates a very dangerously cautious approach that says it's dangerous and we shouldn't play in that space. What the Evgeny Morozovs of the world don't understand is that whether anybody likes it or not, the private sector is pumping out innovation like crazy.'' In other words, the U.S. gains nothing from shunning the social media everyone else uses. ''The 21st century is a really terrible time to be a control freak,'' Cohen said. ''Which is a quote Alec and I often use when explaining this.'' Yet control -- over the message, who delivers it, who originates it -- is still a cherished tenet of foreign policy. Morozov no doubt voiced the concerns of many when he wrote: ''Diplomacy is, perhaps, one element of the U.S. government that should not be subject to the demands of 'open government'; whenever it works, it is usually because it is done behind closed doors. But this may be increasingly hard to achieve in the age of Twittering bureaucrats.'' (The fracas over Ross's and Cohen's seemingly frivolous Twitter posts during a recent trip to Syria, a country some lawmakers feel the U.S. should not be speaking with at all, would seem to bear him out. ) When I spoke to Clinton in March, she maintained that the benefits of connection technologies far outweighed the risks. ''That doesn't mean that there won't be problems,'' she said, ''and there are a lot of people who are very risk-averse.'' Clay Shirky, a New York University professor who has engaged in an ongoing debate with Morozov, has given similar advice to members of the State Department. ''The loss of control you fear is already in the past,'' he told me. ''You do not actually control the message, and if you believe you control the message, it merely means you no longer understand what's going on.'' It's one thing for our diplomats to accept that they can't be control freaks; it's another to expect the rest of world to believe that they aren't -- or that social-media companies have no responsibility for how users interact with their services and with one another. What if governments don't make a distinction between a user's message and the message service? In May, Pakistan blocked access to Facebook after a user set up a page promoting ''Everybody Draw Muhammad Day.'' Even longstanding allies of the United States -- South Korea, Italy, Saudi Arabia and Australia -- hold widely divergent views on rights of online assembly and what constitutes protected speech. Then there's the chance that, say, Twitter will be seen in some quarters as an extension of the U.S. government. On this point, State Department officials I talked to were philosophical. ''This may be a huge difference between the governments that control information -- or try to -- and governments that don't,'' Slaughter says. ''They have a harder time understanding the limits of our power. We can't shut down CNN!'' Still, there are real dangers when companies are conflated with states. ''The risk,'' Carlos Pascual, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, told me in February, ''is if and when in a particular country -- whether that's China or Iran or Cuba or North Korea -- there's a perception that Twitter or Facebook is a tool of the U.S. government. That becomes dangerous for the company, and it becomes dangerous for people who are using that tool. It doesn't matter what the reality is. In those circumstances, I think it's still better to allow the tool to exist. But there is some sort of a line there, and we have to respect that line.'' LAST SPRING, Ross and Cohen began leading technology delegations abroad. These trips -- or techdels, as they're now called -- to Iraq and elsewhere (Russia, Congo, Haiti) have since become a staple of American diplomacy. Software engineers, entrepreneurs and tech C.E.O.'s are asked to think of unconventional ways to shore up democracy and spur development. Though the delegations function as traveling idea labs, both Ross and Cohen are obsessed with producing ''deliverables'': giving tech leaders specific assignments to work toward, like building support networks in the U.S. for fledgling Iraqi I.T. companies or finding ways to use crowd-sourcing to stop human trafficking in Russia. In October 2009, Ross and Cohen jointly led a techdel to Mexico City. The idea was to generate novel solutions for countering narcotics crime, an enormous internal problem for Mexico but also an expensive and politically explosive border issue for the U.S. (The U.S. will spend more than $3.5 billion on drug interdiction this year, much of it in Mexico.) In 2009, Ciudad Juarez alone had 2,600 homicides; given the frequent collusion between gangs and the police, witnesses to crimes fear coming forward, which contributes to a kind of narcostate just the other side of the U.S. border. ''The lack of trust in the police is a big part of the problem,'' Ross says. ''The whole concept of anonymous crime reporting has been lost.'' The techdel's highlight was a meeting with Carlos Slim, the telecom giant and currently the richest man in the world (as well as a major stockholder and creditor of The New York Times). Pascual later told me that in the meeting, James Eberhard of Mobile Accord pointed out that even in the lowest-income neighborhoods of Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Mexico City, people have cellphones and use S.M.S. all the time. Why not have a free short code for text messages so that anyone could report a crime? All personally identifiable data would be stripped from the S.M.S. before it entered a centralized database. From the database, the information would be fed into federal and municipal police systems, then could be monitored by a third-party NGO and mapped on the Internet publicly -- in essence bringing anonymity and transparency to crime reporting. Just as important, the actions taken (or not taken) by municipal police forces would also be publicly traceable and monitored. ''I think there was a personal reaction on the part of Slim,'' Pascual says. ''He's fascinated by these 30-year-old entrepreneurs that are two generations behind him.'' According to Ross: ''He went around the room and asked us all of our ages. He started nodding, and he goes, 'This is wonderful.' And he pushes this button and calls in his sons.'' The meeting was scheduled for 40 minutes but lasted two hours. Slim offered, on the spot, to sponsor the free nationwide short code. The program, which is to be implemented this fall, has some easily recognizable challenges. How do you weed out false reports? How do you gain trust in the anonymity of reporting? Recently, Mexico attempted to register all cellphone users in order to counter telephone extortion rackets, but the personal data, which was to be held confidentially, was soon available for purchase at a Mexico City flea market. ''If you get people using these cellphones and reporting crimes and it results in retribution toward somebody because the data really isn't stripped away, then people will never touch it,'' Pascual says. ''We've got to work with our Mexican counterparts and NGOs, the government and outside of government, so that this is something that they adopt and they want and they sustain.'' THE UNDERPINNING PHILOSOPHY of 21st-century statecraft -- that the networked world ''exists above the state, below the state and through the state'' -- was laid out in a paper in Foreign Affairs in 2009 by Slaughter, before she became head of the policy planning staff. Cohen rereads the paper all the time. Ross gives it to all new U.S. ambassadors. It is crucial to how Cohen and Ross see themselves: equal parts barnstormers and brainstormers, creating and sustaining networks of networks. Ross and Cohen share all their contacts and remain in touch constantly, though they're often on opposite sides of the globe. (''Jared and I divide and conquer,'' Ross says.) Their closeness might come as something of a surprise: Cohen was appointed by Condoleezza Rice and still considers her a mentor; Ross was deeply embedded in the Obama campaign. And they pursued very different paths to the State Department. Cohen, who sprinkled his undergraduate years with trips to Africa (his senior thesis was on the Rwandan genocide), managed to set up a meeting with Rice, then national security adviser, when he was only 22. As a Rhodes scholar, Cohen had ditched England for extended travel through Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Iran, where he interacted daily with a younger generation closely interconnected through social media and wireless technology. ''He had insights into Iran that frankly we didn't have in the government,'' Rice recalled when I spoke to her in March. ''He was so articulate about it, I asked him to write up a memo that I could send to the president.'' When Rice became secretary of state, she tapped Cohen, then 24, for the policy planning staff, with an emphasis on youth outreach, counterradicalization and counterterror. In February 2008, large-scale protests against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) sprang up there and in close to 200 cities around the world, organized through Facebook and Skype and instant messaging. ''It was the largest protest against a terrorist organization in history,'' Cohen says. ''In what I'm sure was the very first diplomatic engagement via an online social network, I found the group One Million Voices Against FARC, and I sent a message to the organizer of it. I said: 'I'm with the State Department; are you the one that did this? I'm going to come down to Colombia and see you.' People thought this was weird -- like, almost eerily reminiscent of an Internet date.'' Rice told me: ''He started social networks of people who could talk about how to combat terrorism worldwide. He put that together really pretty much on his own.'' Nearly a decade older than Cohen, Alec Ross spent his early postcollege years as a Teach for America recruit and was slower to join political life. In 2000, he helped found One Economy, a nonprofit dedicated to closing the digital divide that was instrumental in pushing Arabic-language content onto the Web. Ross was particularly successful in getting titans of business and technology, from Bill Gates to the former F.C.C. chairman William E. Kennard, to support his cause. Impressed, the current F.C.C. chairman, Julius Genachowski, picked Ross to run the day-to-day operations for Obama's technology, media and telecommunications policy. In April 2009, Ross joined State. As a Bush-era appointee, Cohen had been walking on eggshells. ''There were all these haters trying to get this guy shot in the head,'' as Ross puts it. ''I read what he'd written, and I'm like, This guy's actually brilliant; he's going to be my partner.'' One apparent paradox of 21st-century statecraft is that while new technologies have theoretically given a voice to the anonymous and formerly powerless (all you need is a camera phone to start a movement), they have also fashioned erstwhile faceless bureaucrats into public figures. Ross and Cohen have a kind of celebrity in their world -- and celebrity in the Twitter age requires a surfeit of disclosure. Several senior members of the State Department with whom I spoke could not understand why anyone would want to read microdispatches from a trip to Twitter or, worse, from a State Department staff member's child's basketball game. But Secretary Clinton seemed neither troubled nor bewildered. ''I think it's to some extent pervasive now,'' she told me in March. ''It would be odd if the entire world were moving in that direction and the State Department were not.'' Half of humanity is under 30, she reminded me. ''Much of that world doesn't really know as much as you might think about American values. One of the ways of breaking through is by having people who are doing the work of our government be human beings, be personalized, be relatable.'' Just such an effort was under way one recent morning in Washington, where Ross and Cohen were meeting with Farah Pandith. Pandith is also the holder of a newly created position: special representative to Muslim communities for the United States Department of State. Born in Kashmir, Pandith emigrated to the U.S. at a young age. Now in her early 40s, she is a vibrant presence in a room and, since she was sworn in in September, has been to 25 countries trying to broaden the scope of U.S. interaction with Muslim communities. She had just returned from India, Pakistan, Qatar and the Netherlands, and she and her deputy, Karen Chandler, were ready for Ross and Cohen's pitch. ''Here's the problem we're solving for,'' Ross said. ''It's physically impossible for one office to engage 1.4 billion people across the planet in a way that involves a lot of air travel. We've got to work with you to build out a connection-technology strategy.'' ''Wherever you go,'' Cohen said, ''there should be a trail of Muslim engagement behind you.'' ''It's the BOF strategy,'' Ross said, pronouncing it boff. ''Blowing out Farah.'' Pandith and her staff laughed. For the next half-hour, Ross and Cohen riffed on BOF: how to take the undoubted asset that is Pandith -- an articulate, attractive female speaking on behalf of the United States to a large, diverse population that continues to suspect this country's motives -- and scale her presence with technology so that her job promises more than a Sisyphean series of intercontinental flights. ''What you did in Doha with the secretary,'' Ross said. ''There's nothing to have kept us from Ustreaming that, and going from an intimate meeting with Farah Pandith, the secretary of state and 12 civil-society actors to something thousands of times larger.'' ''What you need is a really good hash tag,'' Cohen said. After a moment everyone agreed that ''#muslimengagement'' was too long. ''We don't have to come up with that right now,'' Ross said. ''You have a body of great material. We ought to have somebody go through it and do grabs. Figure out over the course of whatever it is you've said, those things that can be encapsulated in 140 characters or less. Let's say it's 10 things. We then translate it into Pashto, Dari, Urdu, Arabic, Swahili, etc., etc. The next thing is we identify the 'influencer' Muslims on Twitter, on Facebook, on the other major social-media platforms. And we, in a soft way, using the appropriate diplomacy, reach out to them and say: Hey, we want to get across the following messages. They're messages that we think are consistent with your values. This is a voice coming from the United States that we think you wanted to hear. So we get the imam. . . .'' ''. . . the youth leader. . . .'' Pandith said. ''We get these other people to then play the role of tweeting it, and then saying, 'Follow this woman,' and/or putting it on whatever dominant social-media platform they use.'' To do the translation, Ross and Cohen suggested the Muslim engagement office bring in 10 bilingual members of the Virtual Student Foreign Service, an internship program Cohen developed to assist U.S. embassies in dealing with social media. Pandith's deputy sat mostly quiet through the meeting but then voiced a concern that must reverberate throughout the diplomatic ranks. College kids translating diplomatic messages from the State Department? In languages their supervisors can't read? ''How do you make sure that what they're posting is vetted?'' she asked. ''In the 21st century, the level of control is going to be decreased,'' Ross said, reiterating what Clinton told me earlier. ''The young woman from Saudi who translates something to Arabic, what she's translating is language that's been vetted, but it's not being handed over to a State Department translator, who's handing it over to State Department public affairs, who's approving it. We're past that.''"
132,The New York Post,2010-01-31,NIGHTMARE IN THE MIDDLE EAST - STRATEGIC ANALYST RALPH PETERS HANDICAPS THE REGION THAT THREATENS OBAMA - AND THE WORLD - IN A VOLATILE YEAR,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,All Editions; Pg. 26,"February 2, 2010",1710 words,"Whatever planet Earth may fi nd in short supply in 2010, violence and misrule will remain abundant, from the most-recent round of Muslim-vs.-Christian massacres in Nigeria to Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez's delight in unleashing his thugs on students marching for freedom. But no region - not even sub-Saharan Africa - competes with the greater Middle East when it comes to wanton savagery, thwarted opportunities and the danger posed to innocent populations around the world. With fanatical terrorists of unprecedented brutality, Islamist extremists pursuing nuclear weapons, rogue regimes, disintegrating states and threats of genocide against Israel, the lands of heat and dust between the Nile and the Indus form a realm of deadly failure that will haunt the civilized world throughout our lifetimes. A survey of the region's key countries - and problems - doesn't offer much good news for the Obama Administration's naive foreign policy efforts: Unlike many other Arab populations, Egyptians have a strong national identity. There's no danger of Egypt breaking into pieces. But no one knows for certain which way this crucial state may tilt when the elder Mubarak makes his exit. Will there be a smooth, corporatist transition from one authoritarian regime to another? Will contenders for power play the populist antiIsraeli card? Will the Muslim Brotherhood emerge as a power broker? Will pogroms and unrest rock the country, leading to a military coup? We don't know - because the Egyptians don't know. Meanwhile, Turkey's current leaders are dragging the country toward the Middle East and away from the West. This will be a crucial year. If upcoming elections fail to satisfy signifi cant portions of the population, Iraq's gears could go into reverse. There's still hope that the Baghdad government will come to its senses - but the old blood feuds and thirst for vengeance go deeper than we thought. Oh, and who's behind the Iranian move to ban the Sunni candidates? Ahmed Chalabi, the man who convinced the Bush administration that we'd be welcomed with rose petals. And the Pakistani media, with the government's blessing, blames us when the Taliban bomb a marketplace. Isn't it about time we got a grip? Around Pakistan's throat? But what about those nukes? What if they get mad at us and hand them over to terrorists? They won't. But if we're worried about the nukes, plan to destroy them - or leave that job up to India. Leaving the greatest power in history at the mercy of the impossibly corrupt regime in Pakistan guarantees that our troops lives are wasted next door in Afghanistan. Afghanistan isn't our problem. Pakistan's the problem. And India's the future. Will Israel strike first? Perhaps. Would the US? Not under this administration. The best hope is for a miracle that leads to a popular overthrow of the current maddened regime. But strategy can't be based upon the expectation of miracles. Should we just leave? No. Afghanistan provides a crucial base for striking the terrorists across the border in Pakistan. But a reduced presence and a willingness to back sympathetic Afghan tribes offers far more return on our investment of blood and treasure than trying to turn Islamist fanatics into third-rate Americans. In a war-torn tribal society, you have to pick your tribes. Afghanistan is worthless in itself. Instead of concentrating on killing our enemies, we're buying worthless real estate with American blood. SAUDI ARABIA: Its two main exports are oil and fanaticism. Saudi funding supports a global effort to drive Muslims into the fold of its severe Wahhabi cult - and to prevent Muslims (including those in the US) from integrating into local societies. The Saudis care nothing for the fate or suffering of fellow Muslims (check out the Palestinians). They care only for their repressive version of Islam. The birthplace of Bin Laden, Saudi Arabia's differences with his terror organization are over strategy and tactics, not over their mutual goal of forcing extremist Islam on all of humanity. Ralph Peters' latest book is ""The War After Armageddon."""
133,Jerusalem Post,2010-11-09,Is Obama a pragmatic  politician or an ideologue?,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,OPINION; Pg. 16,"February 22, 2011",845 words,"What effect will the congressional elections have on US foreign policy, and on Middle East policy in particular? It isn't a matter of individual candidates, since nobody lost or won who will have a big influence on US policy in the next couple of years. The important factor is to what extent the White House hears the message delivered by the electorate, which is largely concerned with domestic issues. Will a Republican majority in the House of Representatives force a shift, since the White House really controls foreign policy? This brings us to the central issue: Is President Barack Obama pragmatic, or is he an ideologue with no grasp of the real world? After almost two years we are still asking because very little is really known about this man. If Obama is a pragmatic politician, he will take note of three things. First, his foreign policy has not won great applause from the American people. Second, his foreign policy has not won great applause - at least outside Western Europe - from foreign leaders. Third, his foreign policy has not resolved any issues. In addition, much of his policy in the Middle East has actually failed, certainly regarding Israel-Palestinian issues, Lebanon and Syria. Regarding Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, one can argue that he has succeeded in putting on tougher sanctions, withdrawing US troops and continuing the war against the Taliban. This success, however, may be deceptive. Iran is hurt by the sanctions, but is still racing toward nuclear weapons. Iraq is in crisis, with no government, continuing violence and growing Iranian influence. The government in Afghanistan is teetering between collapse and some kind of poisonous deal with the Taliban. Here, though, we see the secret of Obama's Middle East policy, which has worked relatively well for him at home: try to maximize quiet and minimize conflict. What many have failed to recognize is that by appeasing, flattering and engaging, Obama has avoided any open confrontation. This makes it possible to tell the American public that things are going well, that they are not hated, and there is no new war looming. Meanwhile, the US has been lucky to avoid a new catastrophic terror attack. It is possible to argue credibly, then, that things are going okay. Of course, the problem with this approach is that a crisis postponed is a crisis intensified. As Iran moves toward nuclear weapons, as the radicals advance, as Lebanon is lost, as the Turkish regime joins the enemy and Hamas is made secure in the Gaza Strip, the US position in the region deteriorates. BUT RETURNING to Obama, the question is whether he will act pragmatically, or be deaf to information and act as an ideologue. We will only know next year. It is hard for me to believe that Obama and his administration will act in a suicidal manner, but it could happen. One concern is the policy process. After all, if Obama is going to change course, someone on his team is going to have to persuade him to do so. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton can't do it because she is a political rival. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates can't do it because he's distrusted as a Bush carryover, and is too much of a careerist to speak out. This leaves the White House staff - the most ideological yet internationally inexperienced sector of the government. The national security adviser is now a ""yes-man"" who isn't going to persuade the president of anything. At some point, there might be a political operative who will say: If you are going to be reelected, you must do things differently. That man could be David Axelrod, architect of Obama's rise, who is now working on his reelection. It is hard to imagine anyone else capable of turning Obama around unless he himself decides that major foreign policy shifts are needed. The word ""pragmatic"" here means that he will take note of failed policies and adjust them. The word ""politician"" means he will not follow the unpopular course of bashing Israel. He will also want to avoid looking foolish by promising to keep Iran from getting nuclear weapons and failing, for example, or by pledging a quick solution to the Israel-Palestinian issue and failing. The goal of this new realism, of course, would be his reelection in 2012. It is a measure of Obama's unpredictability that the above cannot be taken for granted. He may really believe he is destined to bring about an Israel-Palestinian ""solution."" But how? By trying to impose a settlement? By recognizing a unilateral Palestinian declaration of independence? Who can say? Equally, he can continue to ignore Syria's behavior, Turkey's regime, Lebanon's drowning and the Arab loss of faith in a strong, protective America. The interesting question, then, is whether the foreign policy disaster will be clearly visible before or only after the 2012 election. How many Barack Obamas do you need to change a light bulb? Only one, but he has to want to change it.

134,Right Vision News,2010-04-20,Bangladesh: Israel is the world's true rogue state,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"April 20, 2010",,"Dhaka, April 20 -- In 1976, then US secretary of state Dr Henry Kissinger produced a list of countries his administration accused of sponsoring international terrorism. For obvious reasons, the list included Cuba and North Korea, alongside three Arab countries: Syria, Iraq and Libya. Iran was added after the Islamic revolution and Sudan joined the club following the 1989 military coup. But because the concept of terrorism is elusive and extremely difficult to define, it means different things to different parties. Hence, the list remained exclusively American, reflecting the national interests of the US, rather than becoming something universally accepted. In pursuit of more consensus and to make the list internationally acceptable, Dr Martin Indyk, special adviser to president Bill Clinton on the Middle East and former ambassador to Israel, suggested in the early 1990s a new term to describe these countries: rogue states. Although defining a rogue state was much easier than defining terrorism, the new concept created more problems than it solved. Most political analysts describe a state as rogue when it does not abide by international laws, violates the UN Charter and uses force or the threat of force to maximise its gains in the international arena. According to this definition, most countries are rogue states because they behave this way when they deem it necessary. In the absence of an overarching, universal authority, the international system is an environment in which states must do whatever it takes to maintain security, sometimes through violating the law. This assumption is based on the fact that all states exhibit similar foreign policy behaviour despite their different political systems and that the structure of the international system makes them act the way they do. Yet, although states are functionally similar, they differ greatly in their cap-abilities. States may be alike in terms of the challenges they face, but different in their abilities to perform them. The capacity of states to pursue and achieve their objectives varies according to where they are placed in the international system and, even more fundamentally, their relative power. In this context, states, like individuals, break the law to different degrees depending on the power they have and whether it allows them to do so with impunity. Weak states are, therefore, limited in how much freedom they have to act outside the law. They are usually constrained by the forces of the international system, which is dominated by the great powers. Hence, when Saddam Hussain invaded Kuwait in 1990, the international community - led by the US - punished him. But when the US invaded Iraq in 2003, it got away with it. The different responses to similar actions are explained by the power differential between the two countries. Lust for power In an archaic system, weak or small states may break the law in pursuit of their own survival, but powerful ones do so in pursuit of universal or regional domination. Here, strong states conduct their policies with complete disregard for international law and conventions and, hence, are considered to be 'rogue' in nature. The only regional state that deserves this title is Israel. It defies international laws and violates the UN Charter, not out of security requirements, but in pursuit of supremacy and material gains. It occupies foreign lands, violates the rights of populations under occupation and uses excessive force to subjugate them. It steals the national resources of the Palestinians - water and fertile lands - and makes the lives of powerless civilians miserable. Furthermore, while the countries listed by Washington as rogue states are considered so in the light of the national interest of the US, in the court of international public opinion things do not look quite the same. Recent surveys in many parts of the world have shown increasing unease with Israel and its policies. In Europe, for example, increasing numbers of Europeans think that Israel - and not Iran, Libya or Syria - is the major threat to international peace and security. Gone are the days when Israel was regarded by most of the western world as a victim, trying to survive in a hostile Arab environment. Israel's defiance of the international community and its resistance to US efforts to revive the Middle East peace process have confirmed its status as an outlaw. The apparent Israeli assassination of Hamas commander Mahmoud Al Mabhouh in the United Arab Emirates in January has made this fact all too clear. The killing of Al Mabhouh triggered a wave of international outrage over the use of fraudulent passports by the assassins and earned Israel the title of 'the world's true rogue state'.

135,The Nation (Thailand),2010-06-17,Dilip Hiro,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"June 16, 2010",1120 words,"YaleGlobal Long, unfinished wars in Iraq and Afghanistan - coupled with global recession - are seen as symptoms of the relative decline in US economic and military clout. Rising powers such as Turkey and Iran in the Middle East and Brazil in South America now challenge the diplomatic supremacy of America. Last week, the new contours of diplomatic power were on display in Istanbul. The city hosted the summit of the 20-member Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building in Asia, presided over by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan. It also provided a venue for the first Turkish-Arab Cooperation Forum. A member of Nato - and until recently a rare regional ally of Israel - Turkey basked in the limelight. An emboldened Turkey also defied Washington, voting against the US-sponsored resolution on Iran sanctions at the UN Security Council. Radically changed domestic political configuration and an altered external environment have spurred Turkey to a leading role. In mid-May, along with his Brazilian counterpart, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu signed a deal with Iran, undercutting US efforts to isolate Iran for refusing to abandon its uranium-enrichment programme. Iran agreed to ship 1,200 kilos of its low-enriched uranium to new friend Turkey rather than Russia as proposed by the European Union. In return, Russia and France would provide 120 kilos of medium-enriched uranium for a medical research reactor in Tehran. A fortnight later, Turkey found itself centre-stage when Israel attacked a flotilla, sponsored by a Turkish human rights organisation, on its way to blockaded Gaza with civilian supplies. That assault left nine Turks dead and killed the two-decades-old special relationship between Turkey and Israel. These episodes established Turkey as a rising middle power in a strategic region. They are an integral part of a process which began with a peaceful political earthquake - the November 2002 victory of the Justice and Development Party, Adalet Kalkinma Partisi, or AKP, a reformist party with Islamic origins, ending half a century of opportunistic coalition governments. Along with a sweeping anti-corruption drive by the AKP government, led by Erdogan, was an overarching review of foreign policy. To fully realise its power and influence, argued Davutoglu, then political science professor and Erdogan advisor, Turkey must utilise the strategic depth of its neighbourhood, focusing on those with whom it has cultural affinity. This led Erdogan to forge cordial links with Iran and Syria. The government mediated between Syria and Israel to resolve the issue of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights - without success due to change of governments in Israel. After re-election in July 2007, the Erdogan government reconciled with historic foes Armenia and Greece. As a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, Turkey worked with Brazil to construct a deal on the issue of Tehran's nuclear programme that restored core elements of the October 2009 agreement that unravelled after Iran changed its mind. To Turkey's disappointment, the Obama administration backtracked, insisting on a suspension of enrichment, reverting back to its predecessor's stance, which was unacceptable to Tehran. This did not surprise most Turks: A 2009 Pew Global Attitudes survey showed only 14 per cent had a favourable view of the US, the lowest figure among 25 nations surveyed. In pursuit of its doctrine of cultural affinity, Turkey hosted the 57-member Islamic Conference Organisation summit in 2004. Backed by Saudi Arabia and Iran, its nominee was appointed ICO secretary-general. Around that time, relations with Israel began to cool. Turkey's diplomatic recognition of Israel can be traced to its application for Nato membership. Recognising Israel was a US pre-condition; Turkey did so and became Nato's sole Muslim member in 1952. That did not inhibit the Turkish government from recognising the PLO in 1986. Following the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo Accord of 1993, the relationship between Turkey and Israel blossomed. In 1997 the two countries signed a free-trade agreement. Military cooperation increased to the extent that they conducted annual joint armed-forces exercises. Ankara allowed Israel to set up a clandestine listening post near its border with Iran. In the wake of Israel's attack on the flotilla, Ankara cancelled upcoming military exercise with Israel. While both sides will honour current defence contracts, there's no prospect of further military deals. The boycott of the Hamas government in the Palestinian territories in 2006, followed by the Israeli attack on Gaza in December 2008-January 2009, strained Israeli-Turkish relations to a breaking point. Fatigue has set in among Ankara's policy-makers in another diplomatic field. While they have not withdrawn their application for full membership in the European Union, they are less keen for acceptance. Given the eurozone's economic crisis and the persistent opposition of Germany and France to Turkey's membership, the EU gloss has worn off. Reorientation in Ankara's foreign policy dovetails with domestic developments. For decades after the republic's founding in 1923, affluent, university-educated, Westernised elites - popularly called White Turks - dominated the military, bureaucracy, judiciary and education, exercising disproportionate power. Their power eroded as rural folks migrated to urban centres in large numbers from the 1960s, became literate and realised the power of the ballot. Starting in the mid-1980s, an increasing number of Turks benefited from unprecedented access to information and personal mobility. With literacy rate at 90 per cent-plus, working and lower middle classes lost their awe of the White Turks. Rural immigrants to cities - accounting for a quarter of the national population of 72 million - found solace in the mosque and the AKP. In the unfamiliar, impersonal urban environment, they found ethical moorings in Islam. They became beneficiaries of the Erdogan administration's adroit management of the economy, with annual GDP growth of 5 to 7 per cent. In fact, Turkey's growing economic might undergirds its political ambition. The World Bank ranks Turkey, with per capita GDP of US 12,480, as an upper middle-income country. Its debt of 49 per cent of GDP is healthy, far below that of leading Western nations. Turkey withstood the global credit crunch better than most. No bank has gone bankrupt due to tough regulations, with AKP well aware that banks were the major source of corruption among the traditional secular parties. Erdogan foreign policy realigns Turkey with its history and geography, in the process raising its regional and global status."
136,The New York Times,2010-02-21,The Enemy Within,Late Edition - Final,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,Section BR; Column 0; Book Review Desk; Pg. 22,"February 21, 2010",657 words,"Wendell Steavenson is the author of ''The Weight of a Mustard Seed: The Intimate Story of an Iraqi General and His Family During Thirty Years of Tyranny.'' Power, Politics, and the Clash of Arab Civilizations By Lee Smith 239 pp. Doubleday. $26 As the rubble begins to be cleared in Baghdad and the clamor of reporting moves on to Afghanistan, it's time to take a step back to appraise the regional panorama. Whither the Middle East? Lee Smith asks. Why is the region so assailed by the intractables of political dysfunction and religious violence? How can the United States navigate vested interests (including its own oil dependency) and address a deep seam of anti-Americanism amid a complex network of frenemies? Smith, a Middle East correspondent for The Weekly Standard, contends in this short, dense, nuanced polemic that the area suffers from endemic political violence. The ruling elites are caught in ''a perpetual pincer movement'' between regional concerns and the internal threat of overthrow. They are simply self-interested factions trying, by any measure possible, to retain their grip on power. Jihad, Smith argues, is an age-old byproduct of this struggle as the ruler pushes the energies of the young militant warrior class away from his capital. For Smith, the 9/11 attacks were less the result of a clash of civilizations than part of existing Middle East power struggles. Smith wants the American left to stop blaming American foreign policy for the Middle East's ills and concentrate instead on the structural deficiencies of the region's societies. This is an enticing exoneration, but the United States is undeniably a player, and a certain amount of responsibility must surely go along with military hardware, troop deployments and subsidies to various regimes. ''The Strong Horse'' threads its way through Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and the gulf states. Smith delves into history and pits his position against those of (among others) Edward Said, Naguib Mahfouz, the Muslim Brotherhood and Omar Sharif. I suspect that readers without a fair grounding in the region may get lost in Smith's descriptions of Lebanese politics, Syrian interests and the complexities of Islamic reform movements. But from time to time he treats us to beautifully written portraits of his Arab friends, individuals who illustrate far better than finely wrought theory the difficulties of practical reform. One is an Egyptian named Raouf who is 23 years old, has studied Kant and can argue the merits of Thomas L. Friedman's work, but who is isolated among his companions -- they have little interest in political philosophy. Raouf burns his own unpublishable articles. ''Who am I writing for except myself, anyway?'' he asks in a moment filled with pathos. In such a cauldron, Smith argues, idealistic American efforts to democratize the region are doomed: ''Repressive violence and terror are two aspects of a political culture that has no mechanism for either sharing power or transmitting political authority from one governing body to another except through inheritance, coup or conquest.'' Liberal Arab thinkers have always been subverted by violence. You get the government you deserve, Smith says, backed by Plato: ''The states are as the men are. They grow out of human characters.'' The premise of the book, the quote from which the title is taken -- ''When people see a strong horse and a weak horse, by nature, they will like the strong horse'' -- is Osama bin Laden's. Perhaps I just don't want bin Laden to be right, but I don't believe Arabs prefer the strong horse; it's just that it's all too easy for the violent few to hold the majority hostage. Smith sees this as an embedded cultural inheritance. I prefer my history less dogmatic; after all, for hundreds of years the Ottoman Empire presided over a relatively peaceful Middle East. Arabs aren't necessarily doomed forever, but their political miseries are not likely to be ameliorated anytime soon. Smith is probably right to conclude, ''There is no alternative, not yet anyway, to the strong horse.''"
137,The Globe and Mail (Canada),2010-06-01,Raid drives rift between close allies as Turks unite in anger against Israel,,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,REPORT ON BUSINESS: INTERNATIONAL; MIDDLE EAST / ISRAELI FLOTILLA RAID / THE FALLOUT; Pg. A1,"September 13, 2010",467 words,"Turkey and Israel were until recently the closest of allies, their people and governments united in the sense of isolation and co-operation that comes from being democracies in the Middle East, both nations of ethnic outsiders surrounded by Arab states. But the scene in Istanbul on Monday, as tens of thousands of furious Turks marched on the Israeli consulate and filled Taksim Square in a mass expression of outrage at the Israeli military's raid on the Turkish-organized Gaza relief flotilla, threatened to tear apart any remaining sense of allegiance. While Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a former Islamist, has brought a more critical voice to the country's relations with Israel during the past few years, Monday's attack widened the anger to encompass the secular opposition and other quarters usually allied with Israel, observers said. ""Relations between Turkey and Israel have not been the best for a few years, but before it has divided people, with some Turks very much in favour of better relations,"" said Cengiz Candar, a prominent Istanbul journalist. ""But what happened on Monday morning has brought everyone together, secular and Islamic, all political parties and walks of life - it has done irreparable damage to the relationship."" In an indication of the raid's dreadful timing, Turkey was about to hold joint military exercises with Israel, as the two countries have maintained close military alliances despite growing political differences, and co-operated on a wide range of activities behind the scenes. The exercises were cancelled Monday. The Turkish foreign ministry declared in a statement that the raid would have ""irreversible consequences in our relations."" About 400 of the 581 aid workers on the Mavi Marmara, a ship with a large Turkish flag on its side, sponsored by a Turkish charity, that was the largest of the ships in the flotilla, were Turkish, making it likely that at least some of those killed were Turkish citizens. The raid caused Mr. Erdogan to cut short his trip to South America and to recall the Israeli ambassador. He described the raid as an act of ""inhuman state terror"" - language that had never before been used to describe Israel's relationship with Turkey. After strong language was used in the wake of the 2006 Israeli attack on Lebanon, which prompted an angry Turkish public response and a rejection of Israel by Mr. Erdogan, the fury quickly died down and relations were normalized. Turkish-Israeli relations had remained close until 2006 under Mr. Erdogan, and in military and diplomatic spheres had stayed co-operative afterward. This time, the anger seems more universal. Turkey still has strong business and tourism links with Israel. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis each year visit the beaches and cities of Turkey, considered a rare example of tolerance toward Jews among Islamic countries. Turkey's strictly secular culture allows alcohol sales and prohibits the wearing of the veil in public places. And Turkey played a key role in mediating between Israel and Syria, a diplomatic function that withered only after 2006. The collapse in relations with Turkey could have repercussions. Turkey holds a seat on the United Nations Security Council and has the second largest military force in NATO. On Monday night, Turkey called an emergency meeting of the Security Council. Mr. Erdogan has pursued closer relations with neighbours Iran, Iraq and Syria recently, while pursuing a tighter bond with the European Union. Turkey and Israel have trade relationships worth more than $2.5-billion a year, after signing a free-trade agreement in 2000, according to Turkey's State Statistics Institute. Turkish companies have major building and infrastructure contracts in Israel. ""It's possible for there to be a total rupture in Turkey-Israel relations,"" Alon Liel, a former senior official in Israel's foreign ministry responsible for Turkish relations, told Business Week on Monday. ""This would be an unbelievable blow."" 138 of 266 DOCUMENTS BBC Monitoring Asia Pacific - Political Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring September 13, 2010 Monday News agency reports floral baskets sent to North Korean missions Text of report in English by state-run North Korean news agency KCNA website Floral baskets sent to DPRK missions Pyongyang, September 13 (KCNA) - ministries, political parties, organizations and institutions and personages of various social standings of different countries sent floral baskets to the DPRK missions in relevant countries between Sep. 3 and 8 on the occasion of the 62nd birthday of the DPRK.

139,The Jerusalem Post,2010-01-17,US has limited leverage on Ankara to mend ties with Jerusalem,,,Newspaper,HIGHLIGHT: ANALYSIS,,ENGLISH,NEWS; Pg. 3,"January 21, 2010",704 words,"WASHINGTON - Turkey is showing no signs of adhering to entreaties from Washington that it improve its relations and rhetoric with Israel, as another week of recrimination and resentment has led to one of the lowest points in Israeli-Turkish relations in recent memory. Though the Obama administration delivered a message to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his early December visit to Washington that it was important for Turkey to mend fences with long-time ally Israel, a brief ebbing in tensions flared up again as a stridently anti-Israel program was broadcast on TV and resulted in a harsh diplomatic exchange between the two countries, including the summoning of both ambassadors. ""Obama did the right thing,"" said Soner Cagaptay of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy of Obama's efforts mediate an easing of the strain between the two countries. But he added that the strong internal standing of Erdogan's Islamic political party, the AKP, and his ideological zeal means even the appropriate steps from the White House yield little. ""Even if Obama does the right thing, the AKP is at a point with its foreign policy that it doesn't care, because it's been emboldened domestically and it has a singular obsession with Israel,"" he said. ""Obama's effectiveness is limited, not by his ability to deliver his message, but by the AKP's ability to digest it."" He added that the party has ""a perception that the US's power is not what it used to be, as the US is getting pushed around in Afghanistan and Iran,"" and that means ""it has been transformed from the mighty superpower to the superpower that can be managed."" One Washington source who closely tracks relations with Turkey said that the AKP had been concerned that Barack Obama might recognize the Armenian genocide and take other steps inimical to Turkey upon assuming the presidency, given his campaign rhetoric. But he said that the administration's early meetings with Turkish officials, and Obama's decision to give his first address in a Muslim country - and one of the first international speeches of his presidency - in Ankara, reassured them that if anything the US felt it needed Turkey more than visa-versa. ""They have less leverage with Turkey than they once did,"" he said, pointing out that the shift has also trickled over to other issues, such as Iran, to which Turkey has made overtures and ruled out sanctions, to America's chagrin. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Americans explored the idea of restoring Turkey to the role of mediator between Israel and Syria in indirect peace talks that broke off last year as a way of ""incentivizing"" Turkey to improve its relations with Israel, but that there was little interest on the Israeli side - having lost so much trust in Turkey - and in Turkey for ""reorienting and rebalancing their regional orientation."" Cagaptay assessed that while Ankara would very much like to regain its position in Israeli-Syrian peace-making, ""the ideological position on Israel is so strong that it is trumping that carrot."" Bulent Aras, a Turkish international relations professor who has been traveling with the Turkish Foreign Ministry delegation on its recent trip abroad, questioned the premise that the US would affect Turkey's behavior toward Israel or others. ""What kind of pressure will the US apply to Turkey?"" he asked, saying that ""Turkey is on the right side"" of all the issues that the US is concerned with, and that the Obama administration has referred to a ""model partnership"" between the two countries. ""I call this administration a golden era between the US and Turkey,"" he said. ""The only country that deserves pressure from the US is Israel."" Former Israeli diplomat Alon Liel, who participated Thursday with Aras in a conference call on Turkey-Israel relations organized by the New America Foundation, argued that the United States shouldn't be applying pressure on either side. ""The thinking that our big answer will come from Washington and save us is wrong,"" said Liel, who once served in Ankara and asserted that the two countries need to resolve their issues bilaterally. He added, ""I don't think the US has any serious leverage on Turkey in Middle East affairs."""
140,The Jerusalem Post,2010-04-27,Coalition malcontents promise 'hot' summer if demands aren't met. Netanyahu tells Likud faction: Iran trying to distract international public opinion from sanctions by alleging a planned Israeli move against Syria,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,NEWS; Pg. 2,"April 29, 2010",751 words,"The Knesset reconvened on Monday for the first day of the summer session, and diplomatic relations took a prominent place in the weekly meetings of the Knesset's largest factions. But within the coalition, trouble brewed as right-wing Likud MKs put Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in the hot seat in advance of a key party vote, and Israel Beiteinu MKs warned they would ""heat up"" the session if their coalition demands remained unmet. During the first few minutes of the Likud faction meeting, internal Likud politics were on MKs' minds when Netanyahu discussed Israel's foreign policy. ""There is no truth to the allegation that Israel is planning a move against Syria,"" Netanyahu said as the meeting began. ""This is an attempt by Iran and Hizbullah to distract international public opinion from the intended sanctions against Iran."" Netanyahu went on to say that Iran was continuing with its nuclear weapons pursuit, and that while an agreement on sanctions was coming together, the measures would not be decided on within the coming month. In light of these external challenges faced by Israel, Netanyahu called on all Likud members to vote for his proposed change to the Likud's constitution that would postpone internal Likud elections in an effort to reduce tensions within the ruling party. After the faction closed the doors to the press minutes into the meeting, right-wing MKs began to press the prime minister on push-button issues within the party. MK Tzipi Hotovely (Likud) asked Netanyahu about the veracity of rumors regarding a potential interim status deal offered to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. According to Hotovely, Netanyahu responded that ""there were no understandings, decisions or agreements regarding any such deal. The information that published was erroneous."" Hotovely went on to ask about construction in Jerusalem, and said the prime minister answered that ""building in Jerusalem will continue, and we will continue to stand on our essential principles. Jerusalem is a national interest, and we will continue both planning and building in Jerusalem."" But challenges from home in advance of the Likud Central Committee meeting scheduled for this coming Thursday were not the only threat facing Netanyahu from allies as the Knesset session opened. Israel Beiteinu MKs said Monday that they were planning a lively summer session in which they would try and force Netanyahu's government to advance key pieces of their original coalition agreement with the Likud. In front of the cameras, however, Israel Beiteinu Chairman Avigdor Lieberman also focused on less fractious issues from his perspective - international affairs and the Holyland investigation. ""I hope everything will go well, and that in another week or two indirect negotiations will finally be started with the Palestinians,"" said the foreign minister. ""The Israeli government has said from the start that we are willing to begin direct negotiations, without delays or preconditions. Of course, [Special Envoy George] Mitchell should be congratulated on all his efforts. The central question that remains, from my perspective, is the intentions of the other side - and that is something we will need to clarify immediately upon the initiation of the indirect negotiations."" According to MK Danny Danon, the issue of the pending demolition of homes in the Givat Hayovel and Haresha outposts was also raised at the faction meeting. Among the houses slated to be razed are those of the widows of slain IDF majors Roi Klein and Eliraz Peretz, who live in the Givat Hayovel outpost. That has made the issue of demolishing the outpost homes particularly sensitive. According to Danon, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said the state plans to ""change its direction on this issue"" and take a position similar to that regarding the Derech Ha'avot outpost. On Sunday, the government stated its intention to possibly legalize the homes at Derech Ha'avot on condition it is proven that they are not built on private Palestinian property. To date, the state has not yet indicated to the court any intention to legalize the Haresha and Givat Hayovel homes. Several weeks ago, Defense Minister Ehud Barak asked the High Court of Justice for a six-month delay on any decision with regard to the two outposts. The court has yet to respond. The Prime Minister's Office said it could not confirm Netanyahu's comment. But Likud Minister Yuli Edelstein said Netanyahu made a similar reference at Sunday's meeting of Likud ministers."

In his biennial briefing of the closed-door committee, Dagan painted a pessimistic picture of Israel's position in a radicalizing Middle East, with an American ally less supportive than in previous years. ""The security situation in the Middle East today is more complex and more complicated than before, and we are dealing with challenges that we never faced in the past,"" Dagan told the MKs. ""The pragmatic camp is becoming weaker, and the radical side is gaining a certain type of power."" Dagan attributed part of the new environment in the region to a change in US foreign policy. ""The United States' ability to solve conflicts is restricted because of its policy that emphasizes the use of soft power and its unwillingness to use force to resolve conflicts, which restricts America's ability to initialize processes and create a difference,"" he said. During his briefing, Dagan emphasized that the Mossad's analysis of the current conditions with America was based solely on professional analyses of publicly- accessible information. ""Israel's relations with America undoubtedly impact our room for diplomatic movement,"" continued Dagan. ""There is less collaboration between the two countries, and the American government thinks that Israel's actions regarding the conflict are not in accordance with their perspective regarding the resolution to the conflict, which is a solution based on the 1967 border."" Dagan warned that ""Israel is less of an asset to the United States,"" explaining, ""When there was a conflict between the blocs, Israel was an asset, and today it has declined. America's first priorities, as Obama defined them in 2009, are first the end of the Iraqi conflict, eliminating al-Qaida and ending the Afghan issue, and second, restricting nuclear weapons and taking care of Iran, Palestine and Korea. The American decision to support the recent nuclear resolution in the United Nations - whereas in the past they would have opposed it - comes as a result of a change in the American agenda."" Dagan added that the settlements, while a hot topic in Israeli circles, were seen in the eyes of the American government as ""an annoyance or a spoiler to the American administration."" A number of MKs, including Tzipi Hotovely (Likud) and Arye Eldad (National Union) asked Dagan about the likelihood of a resolution being forced upon Israel against the government's will. Dagan said it had been discussed in the past between Israel and the US. ""The idea mostly serves as a threat between the two sides, but one must take into consideration that the idea still exists and must take it into account in the future,"" he said. Dagan added, however, that he did not believe this was America's preferred option. The Mossad chief also discussed the growing and improving relations among Turkey, Syria and Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has, he said, ""a dream of returning Turkey's dominance through going down the Islamic hall. He believes that through Hamas and the Palestinians, additional doors will be opened for him in the Arab street."" To that end, he said, Turkey is also improving relations with Syria and Iran, and they are forming a new anti-Israel coalition. On the bright side, Dagan told MKs that in 2009, Iran had encountered ""unexpected technological barriers and are not advancing as planned on their nuclear weapons project."" ""Achieving the bomb,"" Dagan predicted ""will take them more time than they had planned."""
142,The Jerusalem Post,2010-08-19,"Our new best friend in the Eastern Mediterranean. Netanyahu's visit to Athens underlines that Greece, though not a perfect replacement for Turkey, ticks many of the right boxes",,,Newspaper,HIGHLIGHT: ANALYSIS,,ENGLISH,NEWS; Pg. 3,"September 5, 2010",751 words,"Can Greece replace Turkey as Israel's foremost strategical ally in the Eastern Mediterranean region? To a certain extent, yes, but not entirely. The Greeks can provide air space for Israeli warplanes to practice for long-range combat missions. (Since the withdrawal from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula three decades ago, Israel's minuscule size precluded such activity here.) They also can increase their purchases of sophisticated military hardware made in Israel and expand the sharing of sensitive intelligence data. Greece already is a choice alternative for Israeli tourists, 400,000 of whom used to fill Turkey's relatively low-cost and very comfortable resort hotels. It also offers ample opportunities for shoppers out to buy for less and to sightseers bent on exploring ancient sites like Athens' Acropolis. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu had these considerations in mind when he embarked on his two-day official visit to Athens this week. His trip, the first by an incumbent Israeli prime minister, followed an inaugural visit to this country by his Greek counterpart, George Papandreou, a month ago. Netanyahu's itinerary included a voyage aboard a Greek naval vessel made in Israel as well as meetings with senior military and diplomatic aides as well as with Papandreou himself. However, Greece has several limitations of which Netanyahu surely is aware. Its population is substantially smaller than Turkey's: 12 million compared to 63 million. Hence, its purchasing power is substantially less. Historically, Greece has maintained a correct if not especially cordial diplomatic relationship with Israel. This is due to wide-ranging trade links with the Arab states as well as an active left wing that supports the Palestinian side of the Middle East conflict. The two pro- or neo-communist parties in Greece objected strenuously to Netanyahu's arrival and managed to run up Palestinian flags over the Parthenon in advance of the Israeli leader's tour there. On the other hand, the fact that the Greeks fought Nazi Germany and suffered from its brief occupation while the Jews were the primary victims also must be borne in mind as a coalescing factor. (Turkey, on the other hand, was neutral until the very end of World War II.) Politically, Greece has much less influence over the Arab states than Turkey. Like them, Turkey is a predominantly Muslim state, even though its constitution advocates secularism in governmental as well as social affairs. Ankara's ruling Islamic party, headed by Prime Minister Recep Tayyib Erdogan, even aspires to reassert the regional hegemony enjoyed by the former Ottoman Empire, which ruled in Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut, Jerusalem and Cairo - at least insofar as foreign policy is concerned. However, the Greeks have several advantages. Their country is a longtime member of the European Union, a multi-national body in which Israel is vitally interested and which it would be happy to join if given the opportunity. They also serve as discreet intermediaries for Israel's unpublicized exports to the Arab states. There also is a profound Greek religious interest and involvement in the Holy Land. The Greek Orthodox church is one of Israel's major landowners. Its possessions include churches and monasteries throughout the country (especially in Jerusalem, where its prelates granted the pre-state Zionists permission to build the attractive Rehavia neighborhood on land adjacent to the Monastery of the Cross). And thousands of Greek Orthodox pilgrims flock to Israel annually, especially for Christmas and Easter on the dates designated by the Greek religious calendar. Actually, an Israeli swing away from Turkey toward Greece - because of Erdogan's hostile rhetoric and behavior, especially since the May 31 seizure of a Gaza- bound flotilla by the Israeli navy and the death of nine Turkish passengers on board one of the ships - could backfire on Ankara. It already has undermined Turkey's ability to act as a regional mediator (between Israel and Syria, for example), prompted grave warnings from the US that military equipment sought by the Turkish armed forces may be withheld and thrown Turkey out of step with the international effort to deter Iran from expanding its nuclear development program. Inevitably, Greece will act in its own best interests. And if these include the upgrading of military and business links with Israel (whose burgeoning economy also could help Athens solve its financial problems), so be it - unless Greek public opinion stands in the way."

145,BBC Monitoring Former Soviet Union - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-03-19,Russian daily examines USA's effort to mend relations with Israel,,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"March 19, 2010",,"Text of report by the website of government-owned Russian newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta on 18 March Article by Yevgeniy Shestakov under the rubric ""We Are Keeping an Eye on the Situation"": ""The Housing Question"" Washington has found itself at the ""crossroads"" in the discussion of the Middle East conflict. A very strong explosion occurred in the region on the eve of the session of the ""quartet"" of Middle East mediators scheduled in Moscow on Friday. This time, it is true, it was a diplomatic one. One must not rule out that the increasing tension in Palestinian-Israeli relations will cost the Democrats who are in power in the United States dearly. At hand is Washington's obvious inability to reconcile the eternal rivals. This is happening against the background of contradictory, at times mutually exclusive statements by American officials who are giving an evaluation of the situation in the Middle East. Before the Middle East ""quartet,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to impose order in the ""diplomatic batteries"" in order to present a unified US position in Moscow. It is true, however, that to do so she had to make a considerable number of fine-sounding statements. The head of the foreign policy department harshly criticized the mass media and a number of officials concerning the existence of a crisis in relations between Washington and Tel Aviv. Some analysts rushed to call this political cooling caused by Israel's plans to build 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem, the most serious in the last half century. ""The United States and Israel have close and unshakable relations just like the peoples of the two countries, who are united by common values and the desire for a democratic future of the world,"" the secretary of state said. Nonetheless, she acknowledged the existence of disagreements in relation to Tel Aviv's settlement activism, which causes ""alarm and disappointment."" But such a statement on Clinton's lips sounded like an insignificant factor that cannot have an effect on the White House's strategic approaches. In that same context, Clinton explained the refusal by George Mitchell, the US Special Envoy for the Middle East, to visit Israel -- the trip was supposed to begin on Tuesday but was postponed indefinitely. Phillip Crowley, an official State Department representative, tried to calm journalists regarding the future of American-Israeli contacts. According to him, ""Mature bilateral relations permit the presence of disagreements. What we have now are such disagreements. But they are not destroying the inviolable link that we have with Israel."" But it would be naive to speak of the end of the conflict that has arisen between Washington and Tel Aviv. Although in the White House, they in fact decided to transfer the discussion to the ""behind-the-scenes"" level and not provide such states as Iran and Syria additional trump cards from a public dispute surrounding the settlements. The airing of dirty linen in public by US Vice President Joseph Biden, who in the literal sense delivered a sharp rebuke to the Israeli leadership, was not cautiously done, but perhaps intentionally. It happened right after Tel Aviv's construction plans in East Jerusalem -- the Palestinians want to see it as the capital of their state -- became known. The conflict that erupted with the switch to ""personalities"" immediately led to serious disagreements within the American administration. A small explanation is required here. There are two major influence groups operating in Washington that are involved in Israeli affairs. The representatives of the first are united in the organization with the acronym Aipac [American Israel Public Affairs Committee]. It consists of 100,000 members, has a budget of $75 million, and 165 employees work there. These lobbyists support the current course of the Israeli government. Their ideological opponents are part of an association that is called J. Street. Its capabilities are much more modest -- a budget of $3 million and 15 employees. This structure represents America's Jewish organizations that favour a dialogue with the Palestinians, the principle ""peace in exchange for territories,"" reconciliation with Syria, and even talks with HAMAS. It is specifically this influence group, according to sociological polls, that unites 78 per cent of American Jews who voted for Barack Obama in the presidential election. But J. Street's influence in Washington is substantially less than the administrative and -- most importantly -- lobbying potential of Aipac. And both Obama himself and his closest circle must take that into consideration when giving evaluations of the situation in the Near East. The world community's concern over Israel's settlement activism will undoubtedly be reflected in the ""quartet"" in Moscow. But it is unlikely to occur in the form of any ultimatum. In the Meantime It is too early to say whether the ""quartet"" will be able to show the political will to persuade the Palestinians and the Israelis to conduct talks. But Vitaliy Churkin, Russia's permanent representative at the United Nations, has already acknowledged the impossibility of naming even the proposed dates of a full-scale conference on the Middle East, which there has been talk of in Moscow for several years now. ""The lack of progress in the settlement process and the continuing break in the talks does not allow us, unfortunately, to announce the timeline for conducting the conference now,"" Churkin announced.

146,BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-05-16,Paper highlights importance of Russian leader's meeting with Hamas official,,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"May 16, 2010",,"Text of article by Urayb al-Rantawi headlined: ""What comes after Medvedev-Mish'al meeting?"" published by Jordanian newspaper Al-Dustur on 15 May ""Russia does in public what the Quartet parties do in private."" With this phrase, the Russian Foreign Ministry repelled some criticism of the summit meeting in Damascus between Russian President Dmitriy Medvedev and head of the Hamas Political Bureau Khalid Mish'al, in the presence of Syrian President Bashar al-Asad, in person. The Medvedev-Mish'al summit is not the first contact between Hamas and Russia. Mish'al made numerous visits to Moscow and held several meetings with senior officials there. However this is the first time that a Russian president - a president of a superpower - meets with a Hamas leader. This is a significant qualitative development both in the bilateral relations and in Russia's policy towards the Palestinian cause, and will have its ramifications both on Hamas's international relations and even on its positions and political rapprochements. From a Russian viewpoint, as outlined by the Medvedev-Mish'al meeting, Hamas is part of the Palestinian national liberation movement, enjoying the trust and sympathy of an important part of the Palestinian people. Establishing dialogue with it enhances its stature, helps defuse many of the Palestinian internal tensions, and overcome many hurdles on the path of the peace process. At the present time, Russia as the fourth party to the international Quartet, does not oppose what the other three parties demand of Hamas; namely to recognize Israel, accept previous agreements, and end violence. This is an essential premise of the Russian foreign policy and a main axis in Moscow's stand on the Palestinian cause and the Arab-Israeli conflict. However, unlike the other three parties within the Quartet, Moscow deals with these ""demands of the Quartet"" as attainable both through the process of dialogue with Hamas and as a result of the policy of including the movement firstly within the Palestinian political system and finally the peace process. As known to all, the Kremlin now refuses to brand these demands as preconditions to which Hamas must yield unconditionally before embarking on any dialogue with it. The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said the truth. Many influential western states, and capitals where the international decision is made, find themselves either in a ""secret, indirect, and informal"" dialogue with Hamas; or they really want the dialogue but fear that they might anger Israel or upset George Mitchell and the Obama Administration; or occasionally, some of these states do not wish to embarrass President Abbas and his Authority, and Salam Fayyad and his government - under the perpetual pretext that ""they have enough on their plate."" During the last few months, I have listened to senior officials in influential European capitals speaking ""off the record"" [last three words in English] about their relations with Hamas. Some said ""we speak with those who speak to Hamas,"" others neither confirmed nor denied any direct contacts, but needed only to say that the entire issue has become a matter of time, nothing more, nothing less. Nobody speaks to you about the ""Quartet's three conditions;"" rather, some might voluntarily offer to explain how Hamas is getting very close to accepting these conditions. The truce is equivalent to denunciation of violence; accepting the establishment of a state in the [West] Bank, [Gaza] Strip and Jerusalem is equivalent to recognizing Israel; participation in the elections, the government formation, and entering the Authority's institutions means a recognition of previous agreements -in any case, nobody really takes notice of these agreements any more after being violated dozens of times, particularly by the Israeli side. The advanced Russian position towards Hamas seems even more advanced than the positions of many Arabs and Palestinians. It is supported by a similar Turkish position, which is probably more open to the movement. As such, this Russian position brings a new element into the regional and international calculations and formulas that encompass the Palestinian issue and relate to the Arab Israeli conflict. It is important for Hamas to determine now what it seeks from a regional and international recognition of its being, and how it can plan to employ this recognition and make use of it. Does it intend to come one step closer to the diplomatic and political action; how will this reflect on its platform and position; can it strike a balance between opening to the world with its terms and demands on one hand, and preserving the constants of the platform, resistance, and forms of struggle on the other; did it succeed before in bringing together authority and resistance for it to succeed now in bringing together something old -the one who resists - and something new -the one who negotiates - ; what is the distance between the ""national"" and the ""factional"" in this process? In reality, we do not stand before a riddle that is difficult to solve and analyse. Just like other national liberation movements, Hamas has the right to hold onto its constants without intransigence or bigotry. It also has the right to persist in a wise resistance -the kind that raises the cost of the occupation and enables the resisting people at the same time to perpetuate with a life of resistance. It has a duty to adapt to the demands of international relations, and diplomatic and political action. I reckon that coming up with an answer to all of these questions, and formulating it in a new platform of both politics and struggle is the challenge that awaits the Movement in the days to come.

149,St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota),2010-09-07,Islamic scholar appeals to Iran to release hikers,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,NATIONAL,"September 9, 2010",383 words,"PHILADELPHIA -- As the Muslim holy month of Ramadan comes to an end this week, Akbar Ahmed, a prominent Islamic scholar, is asking Iran's supreme leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to show ""Islamic compassion"" by releasing three Americans arrested more than a year ago. They are accused of illegally entering Iran. Josh Fattal, 28, of Pennsylvania, Shane Bauer, 28, of Minnesota and Sarah Shourd, 31, of California were hiking in a mountainous resort area of Iraqi Kurdistan and may have accidentally crossed Iran's unmarked border, their supporters say. They were arrested July 31, 2009, and are imprisoned in Tehran. In a three-page letter conveyed through diplomatic channels, Ahmed, an American University professor and former high commissioner of Pakistan to Britain, appealed to Khamenei to free ""these young people who did not set out to cause problems or tension between the U.S. and the Muslim world."" He wrote that Bauer, a freelance photojournalist; Shourd, a language instructor; and Fattal, an environmentalist with an interest in public health, are actually dedicated to improving U.S.-Muslim and U.S.-Iranian relations. Ahmed expressed concern for the ""mental and physical well-being"" of the detainees, particularly Shourd, whom he described as having ""a lump in her breast, which demands immediate attention,"" and ""a pre-cancerous cervix, which requires treatment every three months."" Shourd and Bauer are engaged to be married, and her condition jeopardizes her life and ability to have children, Ahmed wrote. The couple were living in Damascus, Syria, when Fattal joined them for what was supposed to be a one-week trekking trip. The three met as students at the University of California at Berkeley. Ahmed, who has advised Gen. David Petraeus and State Department officials on Islam and foreign policy, said he was ""one Muslim appealing from his heart to another Muslim"" and had not been asked by any government or agency to initiate the letter. The case was brought to his attention by Fattal's mother, Laura Fattal of Elkins Park, Pa., in suburban Philadelphia The appeal comes ahead of the Islamic ""Night of Power,"" a Ramadan occasion when ""the gates of heaven are open and God blesses us with his special mercy,"" wrote Ahmed, who offered to travel to Tehran to meet with Khamenei."
150,The Majallah,2010-08-05,Where the Sun Rises,"August 5, 2010",419,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"October 26, 2010",,"The AKP's gradual shift to the East Turkey's increasingly confrontational policy towards the West does not have just ideological roots but business ones too. Turkey's diversification of diplomatic relations, and the economic ties it has been developing with several Middle Eastern countries, allows it to move away from its traditionally pro-Western foreign policy. Until then, shopping centers had only existed in solidly upper crust Republican neighborhoods. Now, Turkey's religious majority had combined mosque and mall and was finally facing down the dominant class. In the next decade, the Nineties, Turkey's conservative industrialists came in from the religious hinterland to claim for themselves the moniker ""Anatolian tigers."" Sleepy backwaters such as Kayseri and Gazyantepe turned into boomtowns. The ruling AK Party's (AKP) new assertive Middle Eastern policy draws confidence from these humble commercial beginnings. Equally, when Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan very publicly chastises Israel, he has one eye not so much on the Arab street as Arab markets. A popular theory doing the rounds in Turkey is that the AKP could afford to turn away the IMF last year because of billions of dollars of direct Arab investments in Turkey. The AKP's strong rhetoric during June's Gaza flotilla incident is part of a trend that has been described since 2007 as neo-Ottomanism. Just as the House of Osman's expansionism was driven by profit, so the new Turkish political-bazaari class is motivated both by Islamic traditionalism and the thirst for new markets. Direct flights to Kabul are packed with businessmen. Kabul's sandbag-shielded bars buzz with the sound of Turkish and so do its Sufi séances. Turkish restaurateurs feed Libya's oil-fuelled boom, and its construction magnates sign contracts to shape Tripoli's steel-and-glass skyline. Brazilian-style soap operas featuring amorous escapades set against glamorous lifestyles hold Syrian, Egyptian and Emirati TV audiences spellbound with an alternative vision of how Muslims could live. Arab tourists increasingly visit Istanbul, not to sample its Ottoman cuisine and architecture but to walk around the districts where favorite soap operas were filmed. Politically, Erdogan has usurped Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on the world stage as the Muslim leader who dares tell it as it is. Over the past two years, Erdogan spun NATO member Turkey away from its traditionally pro-Western foreign policy. He famously walked out of a debate with Shimon Peres at the Davos Forum in 2009 after publicly accusing Israel of mendacity for continuing to negotiate on Syria even while it planned to invade Gaza in 2008. This June, even urbane foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu lost his calm during a closed-door security conference in Istanbul and issued a red-faced ultimatum to the Israeli ambassador that his state could no longer continue behaving unilaterally, one of the diplomats present reported. ""On the one hand they're pushing away Israel, on the other they're coming closer to the Arab and Muslim world, as if one step is a consequence of the other,"" said Dogan Tilic, a leftist and author of Utaniyorum ama gazeteciyim (I'm Ashamed to Admit I Am a Journalist). ""Israel has no commercial significance for Turkey while the Arab Middle East is a huge market for Turkey so these frictions are not just because of Erdogan's ideological background but there are also commercial and political reasons."" As Asia's westernmost country, Turkey engaged with the West just after its founding upon the ashes of an Ottoman Empire whose territories once stretched to the walls of Vienna. Mustafa Kemal, a westernizing leader from the Greek port city of Salonica, discarded the Arabic alphabet for the Latin one, imposed classical music over folk songs, banned Sufi brotherhoods, turbans and all other examples of what he considered superstitious folk religion. During the Cold War, Turkey became a western bulwark. Currently, it has the ninth largest number of troops in Afghanistan. And despite the economic crisis roiling the European Union, Ankara still nourishes help of entering the western club. Nevertheless, Turkish politics were and remain tinged by Ataturk's distrust of the West. Despite embracing western culture, he could not forget how the Allies encouraged the Greeks to invade in 1919, hoping it would prompt the dismemberment of the tottering Ottoman edifice. He was similarly aware that, at the end of World War One, the British and French navies moved to within striking distance of the metropolis on the Bosporus. With this in mind, Ataturk created a new capital safe from seaborne intervention in the epicenter of the Anatolian landmass. Now, Turkey has regained its confidence. Erdogan is refocusing Turkish foreign policy onto the Middle East and the Balkans, and he increasingly holds high-profile meetings in the old seat of Ottoman government, Istanbul. At the same time, he continues to modernize the country by presiding over the greatest expansion of government-funded, low-cost public accommodation through a government subsidiary known as TOKI. Battalions of high-rises have sprung up across Anatolia, forever changing the traditional way of life. ""It encourages individualism,"" said Christos Teazis, a Turkey specialist who wrote his dissertation on the AK Party. ""When urbanization started in the 1950s, entire villages were transplanted into the city as neighborhoods. These apartments destroyed this phenomenon by breaking the culture of living with family relatives and encouraging the atomization of the living unit."" Turkish society is changing too. The very public struggle over wearing the hijab in official buildings was settled in favor of the government's preference for lifting the ban. On breakfast TV shows, university professors have been replaced as experts by theology researchers who give opinions based on the Koran. ""Turkey is coming full circle after 150 years or so, and looking beyond even the confines of the Ottoman state,"" argues Graham Fuller, a former CIA analyst and author of The New Turkish Republic and A World Without Islam who believes that Ottomanism is still relevant. ""You still have the meaningful Turkish-Turanian past, one of the most widespread language groups in the world, distant links to universal cultures like the Mongol Empire, Turkish influence in the Caucasus and Central Asia and Turkish roots in China."" When Fethullah Gulen, a religious icon for millions of Turks, broke his silence from his US exile to criticize the Gaza flotilla raid, it gave an insight into how the rise of Muslim influence in Turkish politics is splintering the Islamist front and bringing its infighting into the open. Erdogan was a one-time disciple of Gulen but, worried more than ever that Washington is looking to unseat him, he appears to have moved away from his mentor. Erdogan has recently publicly stated that ""the Turkish nation knows very well on whose behalf the terrorist organization works as a subcontractor."" ""The sun no longer rises and falls on western preferences,"" said Fuller. ""The foreign policy vision of Davutoglu is sweeping and likely to persist in one form or another after the AK Party falls from power."" At one of Ankara's chic malls, Teazis is hanging out, watching the crowds pass. ""It's a sign of the times,"" he says, ""when the ones buying a lot are the covered ladies while the uncovered secular ones just window-shop."""
151,Aljazeera.net,2010-03-06,Iraq: An example for the region,,59,Web Publication,,,ENGLISH,,"March 6, 2010",,"The Iraqi people have voted in free and fair elections locally, nationally and provincially since Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi president, was ousted by the US military in 2003. It has been a bloody and deadly example For the entire Middle East, but this week, Iraqis will show the Arab World once again that their hard-fought freedom and painful sacrifices are an example for all people struggling under oppressive regimes. On January 10, 2007, George W Bush, the then US president, defied critics and ignored popular opinion and political polls in the US by committing more than 20,000 additional American troops to the war in Iraq. ""The Surge,"" as it is commonly called, has since been credited with bringing the Iraqi people more security, less violence and greater freedoms. By July 2008, the surge was heralded as a success from Baghdad to Boston. ""Democrats loudly disagreed"" In originally announcing the highly controversial surge, Bush made a nationally televised gamble to dramatically change the most important US foreign policy of his presidency. While Bush confidently said that the surge was for a ""unified, democratic federal Iraq that can govern itself, defend itself, and sustain itself, and is an ally in the War on Terror,"" Democrats in Washington, DC, loudly disagreed. Bush went on to make clear that more than 20,000 American men and women would be placed throughout Baghdad and the Anbar Province ""to help Iraqis clear and secure neighbourhoods, to help them protect the local population, and to help ensure that the Iraqi forces left behind are capable of providing the security."" The president's bold gambit was belittled and roundly mocked among liberals in the US and Europe - as well as by the future leader of the free world. Moments after the surge was announced, Barack Obama, the then-US senator announced, ""I am not persuaded that 20,000 additional troops in Iraq are going to solve the sectarian violence there. In fact, I think it will do the reverse."" The future president was emphatic that Washington should not only not add troops but that American men and women should also exit Iraq as soon as possible. In announcing his candidacy for president a month later, Obama said: ""It's time to start bringing our troops home ... That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008."" Within months of entering the race for the White House in 2007, Obama started voting against Congressional funding for the troops and campaigning strongly for bringing the troops home. Obama's plan It is fair to say that if Obama would have been president a year earlier than he was, a very different Iraq would have emerged than the one developing today. In June 2006 and September of 2007, Obama voted to bring US troops home from Iraq. If implemented, Obama's wish would have left the untrained Iraqi military force to deal with the sectarian violence alone. Iran, Syria and al-Qaeda would have been left unchallenged in their efforts to destabilise Iraq and surely would have successfully fomented a civil war by moving their secret campaign to arm and entice violent factions out into the open. The deaths of more than 4,300 US soldiers who died defending freedom in Iraq and the tens of thousands of innocent Iraqis killed by the extremists' violence would have been in vain. But thankfully, for Iraqis who believe in democracy and crave freedom, Bush ignored popular opinion and worked closely with military experts to surge Iraq forward and help put it on the path it is today. Monumental change Although Iraq still sees sectarian violence and terrorist bombings all too much, there is no question that the country has made monumental change to its political system and in a relatively short time. This week's free and fair elections are yet another example of a young democracy taking hold in a country where just a few years ago real elections and campaigning were unthinkable. No country in the Middle East gives its people more freedoms than Iraq does today. NGO's are being created weekly; a civil society has emerged to challenge the government's decisions, demand transparency, represent minorities and bring attention to people and issues that were ignored in the past. Iraq has a free press that is unrivalled in the Arab world, unobstructed access to the Internet and a military that is becoming a force to be reckoned with in the heart of the world's most unstable territory. While Iraq's very young democracy is messy, incomplete and imperfect, it is currently the envy of the Arab world. Impatience in the media But the Western media's impatience to see a perfectly developed democracy in Iraq has made it difficult for people to see the important progress that has been made in the seven years this month that the US led a coalition to overthrow Saddam Hussein. Obama's view that America should have given up on Iraq certainly had many supporters in the US when the surge was announced. Then-Senator Joe Biden said after Bush's televised appearance, ""If he surges another 20, 30 (thousand), or whatever number he's going to, into Baghdad, it'll be a tragic mistake."" Then-Senator Hillary Clinton said: ""Based on the president's speech tonight, I cannot support his proposed escalation of the war in Iraq."" And Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi would still be working toward her stated goal ""Bringing the War to an End is my Highest Priority as Speaker."" Iraqis should be thankful that Obama, Biden, Clinton and Pelosi weren't in charge of US foreign policy in 2007. ""Greatest democratic exercise"" This weekend, 19 million eligible Iraqis will be able to participate in the greatest democratic exercise the Arab world has ever seen. Once again, Iraq is holding national parliamentary elections and showing the world just how far it has come in a short period of time. Unlike the 2005 national parliamentary election, the 6,529 candidates this time have been feverishly campaigning for months and their names will be on an open ballot. The Iraqi government has enlisted 300,000 elections officials to watch over the process at the 50,000 polling stations throughout the country, including those ballots cast outside Iraq by Iraqis living abroad. Americans are rightly proud to watch millions of Iraqis go to the polls to cast their ballots for anyone they chose. Demand transparency And like Americans, Iraqis will still need to petition their government, organise around issues and demand transparency even after the final ballot has been counted. While ethnic and religious rivalry continues, the Iraqis will need to denounce sectarianism and embrace nationalism yet again. While political manoeuvring, compromise, scandal and political patronage will unfortunately be a part of any democracy, Iraqis must bravely go to the polls and cast their votes to decide whether Nouri al-Maliki deserves enough seats to return as prime minister. Whoever wins, the Iraqis must also work to quickly form a new and inclusive government with a peaceful transition of its leaders. As Iraqis are learning, democracy is a constant process, not a one-time event. The March 7 election reminds us, too, that Bush's vision for democracy in the Middle East is beginning to unfold with the consecutive democratic elections in Iraq and Afghanistan. As both these countries continue to mature and fine-tune their systems, the question remains andndash; which Arab country will be next? Who will start the long, expensive and bloody process of bringing freedom and democracy to their people? In 2001, George Bush, the former US president, appointed Richard Grenell as the director of communications and public diplomacy for the US permanent representative to the UN. In this role, he advised four US ambassadors - John D. Negroponte, John C. Danforth, John R. Bolton and Zalmay Khalilzad - on the formulation and articulation of US policy at the UN. He and his team have led communications strategies on issues such as: the 'war on terrorism' in Afghanistan and Iraq; peacekeeping operations in Haiti, Liberia, the Congo and Sudan; the conflict in the Middle East; Iran's nuclear weapons programme; a North Korean missile test; the conflict between Syria and Lebanon; and the UN's Oil for Food Corruption investigation, to name a few.

152,Aljazeera.net,2010-03-13,The undoing of Obama's Cairo speech,,59,Web Publication,,,ENGLISH,,"March 13, 2010",,"The visit to Israel by Joe Biden, the US vice-president, may usher in a new stage in US foreign policy towards the Middle East peace process, a phase that is clearly different from what many Arabs hoped for after listening to Barack Obama, the US president, in Cairo last June. At that time, the young and charismatic president, who enjoyed wide Arab sympathy and support during his presidential election campaign, called for ""a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world"", a new start that is based on mutual respect and honest politics. ""America will align our policies with those who pursue peace and will say in public what we say in private,"" Obama said about the Arab-Israeli peace process, calling on Israel to ""stop"" the building of settlements. But just a few months later, Obama gave up on asking Israel to freeze the construction of settlements. He told Time magazine in January: ""If we had anticipated some of these political problems on both sides [Israel and the Palestinians] earlier, we might not have raised expectations as high."" He meant the expectations of the Palestinians, who refused to participate in peace talks unless the Israeli government of Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, declares a total freeze of settlement activities in the occupied territories. Old politics Moreover, the US administration turned the heat up on the Palestinians, urging them to engage in peace negotiations after Netanyahu announced a partial freeze of settlement activities in the West Bank for nine months. When the Palestinians, with Arab backing, agreed to start indirect negotiations, Israeli authorities shocked everyone, including Biden, by announcing new massive settlement construction plans during his visit. Biden responded by a strong condemnation and Netanyahu apologised for the ""timing"" of the announcement. At the end of his visit to Israel Biden told an audience in Tel Aviv that he ""appreciated"" the response of the Israeli prime minister, who ""clarified that the beginning of actual construction on this particular project would likely take several years"". Clearly, Biden failed to stop the illegal settlement plans. A very weak response to what many, including Israelis, considered an ""insult"" to the visiting vice-president. Moreover, his speech at Tel Aviv University was in many aspects the opposite of Obama's Cairo speech. At Cairo University, Obama looked young, idealistic, charismatic and an advocate of change. At Tel Aviv University, Biden looked old, realistic, boring, and pragmatic. Listening to Biden andrsquo;s speech reminds you of Senator Biden speaking to the annual dinner of the Washington-based pro-Israel lobby, Aipac, rather than the US vice-president going on an international tour to push forward the daunting Middle East peace process. In his speech, Biden used many of his old clich andeacute;s that he used in the past to appeal to pro-Israel audiences. Those included statements from his first visit to Israel, his meeting with Golda Meir, the late Israel president, and his belief that ""change will come to the Middle East when there is absolutely no space between America and Israel"" and that ""you don andrsquo;t need to be a Jew to be a Zionist"". It was a sad reminder of the old American political rhetoric that fails to find new common ground between Arabs and Israelis. Moreover, Biden downgraded the US role in the Middle East peace process from one of a guarantor and a sponsor, which Arabs expect, to one of a ""facilitator"", a ""trust-builder"" and a ""bridging mechanism"". Facilitator Biden emphasised his understanding of US role as ""a facilitator"" to a concerning level stressing that ""the US cannot want peace more than the Israelis and the Palestinians want it"". Biden forgot that Arabs joined the current peace process in 1991 at a crucial historical moment. It was only a couple of years after the end of the Cold War and a few months after the US successfully led an international coalition to expel Saddam Hussein, the former Iraqi leader, from Kuwait. At that time, Arabs thought that only America, the sole superpower, could help to deliver peace to the Middle East. Biden also forgot that most of the progress achieved on the Arab Israel peace process - such as the establishment of the Palestinian Authority and the signing of a peace agreement between Israel and Jordan - took place during the years of Bill Clinton's US presidency, when the US enjoyed unparallelled political and economic world power. It was the administration of George Bush, Obama's predecessor, that squandered US prestige and financial advantage on many fronts, and which brought the US peace process to a semi-halt. The Bush-era was known for its neo-conservative bias towards Israel, disdain for diplomacy and distrust of Arabs and their interest in peace altogether. Since Obama came to office, many Arabs have been wondering if the US, under the Bush administration, lost the strategic and political capital necessary to push and guarantee the daunting ""peace process"". They saw a new administration busy with a domestic financial crisis, a divided and partisan political system, two unwinnable wars and competition with China. Some were afraid that Israel was quicker than Arabs in realising America's weakness by fending off Obama's calls for a freeze of settlements. Unfortunately, Biden speech could only deepen such fears. 'Politically costly' Since it came to the White House, the Obama administration has failed to achieve clear progress on many Middle East fronts. It could not persuade or pressure Iran away from its nuclear programmes, Syria away from Iran, Iraqi politicians away from sectarianism, Arab regimes towards democracy or Israel away from its expansionist and confrontational policies. During his speech, Biden told his audience repeatedly that Dennis Ross, a veteran peace negotiator from the Clinton administration and a known pro-Israel advocate, is with him. He said it about three times. Ross serves now as a special adviser to the US president at the US National Security Council. In his latest book, Myth, Illusions, andamp; Peace: Finding A New Direction for America in the Middle East, Ross advocates many of the ideas and policies repeated by Biden and other senior Obama administration officials recently. Ross believes that successful peace negotiation should start with ""gaining a sense of what Israel could live with and then trying to move the Arabs or Palestinian position accordingly"". He ultimately believes that ""it is politically costly for [Arab] regimes that lacked basic legitimacy to look as if they were conceding before getting anything from Israel"". Therefore, he argues against ""pressuring"" or even ""surprising"" Israel. ""American has many roles to play in helping peace andndash; from clarifying, to mobilising financial and political support, to protecting and insulating, to assuring and guaranteeing, providing such guarantees can relate to the agreement itself andndash; meaning the readiness to guarantee the implementation of the terms of the agreement."" ""Common interests"" Unfortunately, such perspective sees peace between Israel and Palestinians as a long term goal that could wait while Arab regimes and Israel could co-operate urgently on more serious threats such as Iran and the Islamists. ""Most Arab governments want Israel to be strong when it comes to Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, and Syria,"" says Ross. He believes that the ""Palestinian issue"" is a public consumption issue for many Arab regimes, an emotional cause that is often used to drain the West and to divert public attention from urgent domestic Arab needs. He argues that recent Israeli wars in Lebanon (2006) and Gaza (2009) did lead to some Arab street protests. But, they did not lead to the overthrow of any Arab regime or to a new oil curfew. Instead, he believes that ""common interests"" between Israel and the Arab countries, on issues such Iran and confronting the Islamists, are larger than expected. He believes that pushing the peace process forward will help strengthen Arab co-operation with Israel on such threats and push up to the surface. However, he obviously does not think it is a priority or an urgent need. Such views are clearly different from what many Arabs hoped for when they heard Obama speak at Cairo last June. They seem on the rise, which deals a serious blow to Arabs' hope for a real change in US foreign policy towards the Middle East under the current administration."
153,Aljazeera.net,2010-07-05,New tensions test old allies,,59,Web Publication,,,ENGLISH,,"July 5, 2010",,"On the eve of the recent meeting between Barack Obama, the US president, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish prime minister, in Toronto, the two sides exchanged soft - but poignant - warnings. Philip Gordon, the US assistant secretary of European and Eurasian affairs, challenged Turkey to prove that it remains ""committed to the National Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO), Europe and the United States,"" while Erdogan questioned whether the US was ""supporting Turkey adequately in its battle against the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK)"". The statements were the strongest public indication of an emerging mutual mistrust between the two allies since the crisis over an Israeli attack on a Turkish Gaza-bound aid flotilla and Turkey's vote against imposing further sanctions on Iran at the United Nations Security Council. 'Turning its back on the West' Washington has so far refrained from criticising Ankara, despite a growing campaign among lobbyists and the US congress targeting Turkey's governing Islamist Justice and Development Party (AKP). Led mainly, but not exclusively, by the pro-Israel lobby and neo-conservatives, this campaign has called for measures ranging from withholding support for the Turkish government to US backing of the opposition in the country's next parliamentary elections. Barry Rubin, a leading neo-conservative, has even called for Turkey to be ""permanently"" written off as an ally. Writing in the Jewish Commentary Magazine, Rubin declared: ""The fact is that Turkey has changed. Gone, and gone permanently, is secular Turkey, a unique Muslim country that straddled East and West and that even maintained a cooperative relationship with Israel."" But even 'liberal' writers have been accusing Turkey of turning its back on the West and attempting to lead a pro-Islamic Arab axis. So far, however, there has been no sign that Obama is ready to downgrade ties with Ankara, let alone treat it as ""an international pariah"". But Gordon's statements suggest that Washington is questioning some aspects of its support for Ankara: ""There are people asking questions about it in a way that is new, and that in itself is a bad thing that makes it harder for the United States to support some of the things that Turkey would like to see us support,"" Gordon said in an apparent reference to Turkey's actions against the PKK. A buffer between East and West But Turkey is too important to the US to be easily sacrificed. The relationship dates back to 1947, when the US, under the Truman Doctrine of then president Harry Truman, designated Turkey as a recipient of special economic and military aid with the intention of combating Soviet influence in Europe and Asia. Turkey became a crucial partner in the post-9 /11 'war on terror' and a key component of the post-Cold War neo-conservative agenda that guided the two administrations of George W Bush, the former US president. The US has relied on Ankara to curb Russian expansion towards the former Soviet, mostly Muslim, republics and to check China's influence in that region. As a non-Arab Muslim state, neo-conservatives viewed Turkey as an important part of a security belt to protect Israel - a buffer between the Muslim world on one side and Israel and the West on the other - and those who sought to fully integrate Israeli security goals into US national security policy, saw Turkey as a more reliable ally than Arab states like Egypt and Jordan. Turkish and pro-Israeli lobbies regularly worked together to promote the interests of both countries on Capitol Hill. The pro-Israeli lobby supported Turkish efforts to prevent a US bill calling the 1915 massacre of Armenians ""genocide"" and to secure US financial and logistical assistance in Ankara's fight against the PKK. In 1999 the US, with Israeli assistance, even helped to kidnap the PKK leader, Abdullah Ocalan, from Kenya. The AKP's ascension to power in 2002 did not affect the country's strategic pacts with the US or Israel. Nor did the Turkish parliament's decision not to allow Turkish territories to be used in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In fact, many American strategists and writers - liberals and conservatives alike - viewed the AKP's modern ruling style as ""a model for other Muslim and Arab countries"" and hoped that the ""moderate AKP"" would placate anti-Western and Israeli sentiments in the Arab world. Washington did, however, rely heavily on the strength of Turkey's military council and Turkish yearning to join the European Union to check the Islamic leanings of its government. At the same time, the AKP's role was boosted by its sponsorship of indirect talks between Syria and Israel. A shifting focus But Turkey was changing. Firstly, the government began placing a greater emphasis on Turkey's Islamic identity and affinity with the causes of the Muslim world. Secondly, in its effort to implement the reforms demanded by the European Union, the Turkish government managed to marginalise the country's military council, stripping it of its power to shape policies. Thirdly, the AKP no longer saw itself as a junior partner in its alliances and sought to assert Turkey's role as a strong regional power rather than a follower in a pro-Western axis. Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, put forward a new paradigm in international relations where Turkey's political weight is derived from expanding and developing its ties with its neighbours to the East - including the Arab world, the former Soviet Republics and Iran. When Obama became US president, Turkey was the first Muslim country he visited in his bid to open a new page with the Muslim world away from the hostile terminology of the 'war on terror'. His visit was viewed as a triumph for Turkey's new strategy and a boost to its perceived role as a power broker between East and West. But the new developments in Turkey alarmed its traditional allies in Washington, particularly neo-conservatives and the pro-Israel lobby - who claimed that Ankara was distancing itself from the West. The Israeli war on Gaza galvanised the AKP's opponents in Washington, while Turkey saw it as a blow to its efforts to mediate between Israel and Syria at a time when it was expecting a breakthrough. 'Payback' Ankara's improving ties with Tehran were also arousing mistrust in Washington, and the Turkish and Brazilian brokered uranium swap deal seemed to confirm the suspicions of those who felt the Turkish government was moving in a direction contrary to US interests. While Turkey may have been asserting its new role and trying to avoid a scenario it saw as destabilising to the entire region, it was not necessarily misunderstood. The Iranian-Brazilian initiative did run counter to US Republican and neo-conservative pressure to support a war or at least an Israeli military strike against Iran. But two events became the catalyst for an all out campaign against the Turkish government in Washington: Turkey's suspension of military maneuvers with Israel, the recalling of its ambassador and demand for an international investigation in the wake of Israel's military interception of the Turkish aid ship; and Turkey's vote against a new round of sanctions on Iran at the United Nations Security Council. The response was swift: A number of prominent Republican and Democrat congressmen slammed Turkey's ""disgraceful conduct,"" warning that there would be ""payback"" if Ankara continued to pursue its close relations with Iran and hostility towards Israel. In conclusion, when Obama visited Turkey in 2009 he declared: ""We are not solely strategic partners, we are also model partners."" No similar statement followed the Toronto meeting, but little has changed in terms of the two countries' mutual needs. The US needs Turkish support troops in Afghanistan and to benefit from Turkey's influence the Black Sea region, the Caucuses and the Middle East. It also needs secure transport from Turkish ports during the eventual withdrawal of US troops from Iraq. Likewise, Turkey needs sustained US support in its battle against the PKK and its apparent splinter groups, which Ankara suspects are backed by Israel. But the US needs to patch up the Turkish-Israeli rapture - partly to placate right wing pressures at home, but also because it is vital to US interests in the Middle East. It is likely that Ankara will collaborate with Washington to stop any further deterioration in its relations with Israel, but may wait until a new government takes over to mend the rift. And while the US cannot afford to bow to right wing pressure to drop its support for Turkey, it may still choose to support the AKP's rivals in the next elections - something US ambassador James Jeffrey's recent visit to Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of Turkey's opposition Republican People's Party, may hint at.

154,Right Vision News,2010-01-27,"Brunei: It's not a new Turkey, it's the right time",,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"January 26, 2010",,"Pakistan, Jan. 27 -- URI Avnery's assessment of the recent Israeli-Turkish diplomatic and political row - that ""the relationship between Turkey and Israel will probably return to normal, if not to its former degree of warmth"" - seems sensible and daring. In my view, however, it is also inaccurate.Simply put, there is just no going back.In a recent article entitled ""Israel Must Get Used to the New Turkey,"" Suat Kiniklioglu, Deputy Chairman of External Affairs for Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) wrote, ""Israel appears to be yearning for the golden 1990s, which were the product of a very specific situation in the region. Those days are over and are unlikely to come back even if the Justice and Development Party (AKP) ends up no longer being in government.""This assessment seems more consistent with reality.One would agree with Avnery's optimistic reading of events if the recent row was caused by just a couple of isolated incidents, for example, the gutsy public exchange over Gaza between Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan and Israel's President Shimon Peres at the World Economic Forum in late January 2009, or the recent premeditated humiliation of Oguz Celikkol, Turkish Ambassador to Israel, by Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon.However, these incidents are anything but isolated. They reflect a clear and probably irreversible shift in Turkish foreign policy towards Israel, the US and the Middle East as a whole.For decades Turkey was torn between its historical ties to Muslim and Arab countries on the one hand, and the unstoppable drive towards Westernisation on the other. The latter seemed much more influential in forming the new Turkish identity in its individual, collective, and thus foreign policy manifestation and outlook.But even during the push and pull, Turkey grew in import as a political and economic player. It also grew into a nation with a decisive sense of sovereignty, a growing sense of pride and a daring capacity for asserting itself as a regional power.In the 1970s, when ""political Islam"" was on the rise throughout the region, Turkey was experiencing its own rethink, and various politicians and groups began grappling with the idea of taking political Islam to a whole new level.In fact, it was Dr Necmettin Erbakan, the Prime Minister of Turkey between 1996 and 1997 who began pushing against the conventional notion of Turkey as a second-class Nato member desperate to identify with everything Western.In the late 1980s Erbakan's Rafah Party (the Welfare Party) took Turkey by storm. The party was hardly apologetic about its Islamic roots and attitude. Its rise to power as a result of the 1995 general elections raised alarm, as the securely ""pro-Western"" Turkey was deviating from the very the rigid script that wrote off the country's regional role as that of a ""lackey of Nato"". According to Salama A Salama, who coined the phrase in a recent article in Al-Ahram Weekly, Turkey is no longer this ""lackey"". And according to Kiniklioglu, that's something ""Israel must get used to"".The days of Erbakan might be long gone. But the man's legacy registered something that never departed Turkish national consciousness. He pushed the boundary, dared to champion pro-Palestinian policies, defied Western dictates and even pressed for economic repositioning of his country with the creation of the Developing Eight (D-8), uniting the most politically significant Arab and Muslim countries. When Erbakan was forced to step down in a ""postmodernist"" military coup, it was understood as the end of short-lived political experiment which ended up proving that even a benign form of political Islam was not to be tolerated in Turkey. The army emerged, once again, all powerful.But things have changed drastically since then. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) was elected to power in 2002. The AK Party leadership was composed of savvy, yet principled politicians who aimed for change and even a geopolitical shift in their country's regional political outlook.The AK Party began to lead a self-assertive Turkey which was neither pleading for European acceptance nor American validation. By rejecting the use of Turkish territories as a launchpad of a US strike against Iraq in 2003, Turkey was acquiring a voice, and a strong one at that - with wide democratic representation and growing popular support.The trend continued, and in recent years Turkey dared translate its political power and prowess into action, without immediately severing the political and military balances that took years to build. So, for example, while it continued to honour past military deals with Israel, it also made many successful overtures to Syria and Iran. And, in being willing to be seen as a unifier in the age of Muslim and Arab disunity, it refused to take part in the conveniently set up camps of ""moderates"" and ""extremists"". Instead it maintained good ties with all its neighbours, and its Arab allies.Starting in 2007, the US began seeing the emergence of the ""New Turkey"". US President Barack Obama's visit to the country soon after his inauguration was one of many signs that the West was taking notice of Turkey's ""special"" status. Turkey is not to be bullied, threatened, or intimidated. Even Israel, which has for long defied the norms of diplomacy, is now becoming more aware of its limits, thanks to Turkish President Abdullah Gul.

Israel, of course, apologised, and humbly so.It took Turkey many years to reach this level of confidence and the country is hardly eager to be anyone's ""lackey"" now. More, Turkey's united and constant stance in support of Gaza, and its outspokenness against the threats against Lebanon, Iran and Syria show clearly that the old days of ""warmth"" are well behind us.Turkey, of course, will find a very receptive audience among Arabs and Muslims all over the world who are desperate for a powerful and sensible leadership to defend and champion their causes.

155,Right Vision News,2010-01-31,"Iran: It's not a new Turkey, it's the right time",,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"January 30, 2010",,"Uri Avnery's assessment of the recent Israeli-Turkish diplomatic and political row , Jan. 31 -- that ""the relationship between Turkey and Israel will probably return to normal, if not to its former degree of warmth"" -- seems sensible and daring. In my view, however, it is also inaccurate.Simply put, there is just no going back.In a recent article entitled ""Israel Must Get Used to the New Turkey,"" Suat Kiniklioglu, Deputy Chairman of External Affairs for Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) wrote, ""Israel appears to be yearning for the golden 1990s, which were the product of a very specific situation in the region. Those days are over and are unlikely to come back even if the Justice and Development Party (AKP) ends up no longer being in government.""This assessment seems more consistent with reality.One would agree with Avnery's optimistic reading of events if the recent row was caused by just a couple of isolated incidents, for example, the gutsy public exchange over Gaza between Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan and Israel's President Shimon Peres at the World Economic Forum in late January 2009, or the recent premeditated humiliation of Oguz Celikkol, Turkish Ambassador to Israel, by Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon.However, these incidents are anything but isolated. They reflect a clear and probably irreversible shift in Turkish foreign policy towards Israel, the U.S. and the Middle East as a whole.For decades Turkey was torn between its historical ties to Muslim and Arab countries on the one hand, and the unstoppable drive towards Westernization on the other. The latter seemed much more influential in forming the new Turkish identity in its individual, collective, and thus foreign policy manifestation and outlook.But even during the push and pull, Turkey grew in import as a political and economic player. It also grew into a nation with a decisive sense of sovereignty, a growing sense of pride and a daring capacity for asserting itself as a regional power.In the 1970s, when 'political Islam' was on the rise throughout the region, Turkey was experiencing its own rethink, and various politicians and groups began grappling with the idea of taking political Islam to a whole new level.In fact, it was Dr. Necmettin Erbakan, the Prime Minister of Turkey between 1996 and 1997 who began pushing against the conventional notion of Turkey as a second-class NATO member desperate to identify with everything Western.In the late 1980s Erbakan's Rafah Party (the Welfare Party) took Turkey by storm. The party was hardly apologetic about its Islamic roots and attitude. Its rise to power as a result of the 1995 general elections raised alarm, as the securely 'pro-Western' Turkey was deviating from the very the rigid script that wrote off the country's regional role as that of a ""lackey of NATO."" According to Salama A Salama, who coined the phrase in a recent article in Al-Ahram Weekly, Turkey is no longer this 'lackey'. And according to Kiniklioglu, that's something ""Israel must get used to"".The days of Erbakan might be long gone. But the man's legacy registered something that never departed Turkish national consciousness. He pushed the boundary, dared to champion pro-Palestinian policies, defied Western dictates and even pressed for economic repositioning of his country with the creation of the Developing Eight (D-8), uniting the most politically significant Arab and Muslim countries. When Erbakan was forced to step down in a 'postmodernist' military coup, it was understood as the end of short-lived political experiment which ended up proving that even a benign form of political Islam was not to be tolerated in Turkey. The army emerged, once again, all powerful.But things have changed drastically since then. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) was elected to power in 2002. The AK Party leadership was composed of savvy, yet principled politicians who aimed for change and even a geopolitical shift in their country's regional political outlook.The AK Party began to lead a self-assertive Turkey which was neither pleading for European acceptance nor American validation. By rejecting the use of Turkish territories as a launchpad of a U.S. strike against Iraq in 2003, Turkey was acquiring a voice, and a strong one at that -- with wide democratic representation and growing popular support.The trend continued, and in recent years Turkey dared translate its political power and prowess into action, without immediately severing the political and military balances that took years to build. So, for example, while it continued to honor past military deals with Israel, it also made many successful overtures to Syria and Iran. And, in being willing to be seen as a unifier in the age of Muslim and Arab disunity, it refused to take part in the conveniently set up camps of 'moderates' and 'extremists'. Instead it maintained good ties with all its neighbors, and its Arab allies.Starting in 2007, the U.S. began seeing the emergence of the ""New Turkey"". U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to the country soon after his inauguration was one of many signs that the West was taking notice of Turkey's 'special' status. Turkey is not to be bullied, threatened, or intimidated. Even Israel, which has for long defied the norms of diplomacy, is now becoming more aware of its limits, thanks to Turkish President Abdullah Gul. Following Israel's belligerent insult of the Turkish Ambassador, he said, ""Unless there is a formal apology from Israel, we're going to put Celikkol on the first plane back to Ankara."" Israel, of course, apologized, and humbly so.It took Turkey many years to reach this level of confidence and the country is hardly eager to be anyone's 'lackey' now. More, Turkey's united and constant stance in support of Gaza, and its outspokenness against the threats against Lebanon, Iran and Syria show clearly that the old days of ""warmth"" are well behind us.Turkey, of course, will find a very receptive audience among Arabs and Muslims all over the world who are desperate for a powerful and sensible leadership to defend and champion their causes.

The cables revealed differences between Arabs. Qatar's prime minister said Egypt was stringing out mediation talks between Palestinian rivals in the peace process for as long as possible, Reuters reports. The United States has condemned the leaks. A May 2008 cable quoted Mubarak, whose country does not have diplomatic ties with Iran, telling a group of US officials that ""we are all terrified"" about a possible nuclear Iran. ""Mubarak said that Egypt might be forced to begin its own nuclear weapons program if Iran succeeds in those efforts."" A July 2009 cable quotes Egypt's intelligence chief Omar Suleiman telling US officials that Iran was harbouring extremists, a hurdle to resuming ties severed for three decades. Suleiman said Egypt was wary of Iran's influence through its Hezbollah and Hamas proxies and its support ""for Egyptian groups like (al-Gama'a al-Islamiya) and the Muslim Brotherhood,"" but that Iran could not ""challenge the international community now"". Suleiman advised against a US strike on Iranian nuclear capabilities, saying it would unite Iranians against the United States. He said Egypt was working to prevent Iranian funds to Hamas, worth US$25 million per month, from reaching Gaza. Suleiman said Egypt had sent a clear message to Iran that if they interfered in Egypt, Egypt would interfere in Iran, adding Egyptian intelligence was recruiting agents in Iraq and Syria. ""Now we have it on paper, in black and white,"" independent Cairo-based analyst Issander El Amrani said of the cable. A December 2009 cable from the US embassy in Tel Aviv quotes Israeli security official Uzi Arad calling Egypt's Foreign Ministry a ""nagging problem"" and accusing it of harming relations with Israel by pushing for a nuclear-free Middle East. Egypt is often portrayed in the region as a docile US partner, but analysts said the cables suggested U.S. officials could get frustrated with Cairo. The messages also confirmed well-known Egyptian positions, such as its wariness of Iran. ""The common impression is that Egypt does not oppose US and Israel, and is too willing to oblige them. But the documents reveal non-Egyptian officials' frustration with Egypt,"" analyst Amr Hamzawy said. Hamzawy, from the Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut, said the cables confirmed what analysts had long suspected about Egyptian foreign policy on issues such as Iran and Hamas. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani was quoted in a February cable as telling U.S. Senator John Kerry that Egypt ""has no end game"" in efforts to reconcile Palestinian factions, and that ""serving as broker of the talks is Egypt's only business interest with the US"" Egypt's Foreign Ministry said it had no immediate comment."

In diplomacy, talk and image are no substitutes for action and substance. John F. Kennedy had: ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."" Harry Truman said, ""The buck stops here."" The definitive statement from the current president, though, comes not from his presidency but from the campaign, when nearly three years ago he made it clear there were miracles to be expected from an Obama White House. At an appearance in South Carolina, the future president told the crowd, ""I am going to try to be so persuasive in the 20 minutes or so that I speak that by the time this is over, a light will shine down from somewhere. It will light upon you. You will experience an epiphany. And you will say to yourself, ""I have to vote for Barack.' "" That light hasn't shined down on those the president has met with abroad. After the voters drubbed the Democrats in the midterms, the president failed to get an expected trade deal with South Korea to expand U.S. exports. Despite devoting himself in September to Israeli-Palestinian talks, new Israeli settlement building on land Palestinians see as theirs has spoiled the expectations Obama set. At home, Senate Republicans last week justifiably balked at lame-duck ratification of the New START treaty with Russia because -- as with ObamaCare -- no one knows what the pact means or does. Commentary magazine's Jennifer Rubin succinctly describes the president's self-inflicted wounds, noting that ""each new foreign policy fumble has a precursor. Seoul is like Copenhagen. New START is like the Syrian ambassador's nomination. The handling of the Honduras ""coup' is like pulling the rug out from under our Eastern European allies on missile defense."" Rubin calls it ""an endless series of half-baked ideas, offended allies, stalled negotiations and poorly executed gambits."" Behold the presumptive miracle worker, bestowed the Nobel Peace Prize on spec. With the force of his good intentions, he was going to rid the world of nuclear arms, beginning with those soon to be possessed by Iran's Islamofascist mullahs. He would charm the Muslim world by taking the blame for the CIA saving Iran from communism in 1953, and all other American ""crimes"" if need be. The president is now finding that his considerable oratorical gifts will not translate into American influence in the world. That takes sustained U.S. strength and a willingness to exercise it unashamedly -- developments that few expect from this president."
171,The Christian Science Monitor,2010-01-14,"Israel-Turkey spat reveals Israel's new 'national pride' policy; Turkey today accepted Israel's second, stronger apology. But changes in both countries' leadership - and in regional politics - are straining a long-standing and relatively close relationship.",,,NEWSPAPER,,Richard Wolf,ENGLISH,NEWS; Pg. 5A,"August 31, 2010",502 words,"The tense stand-off between Israel and its closest Muslim ally, Turkey, began to subside Thursday following Turkey's acceptance of Israel's second, stronger apology for its treatment of Ankara's ambassador to Jerusalem. But the incident revealed a fundamental shift in the leadership and regional standing of the two countries that is likely to affect relations going forward.Only a few weeks ago, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman gathered together Israeli ambassadors from their postings around the world and announced a new style of Israeli diplomacy, says Alon Liel, former director-general of the foreign ministry. This new ""national pride foreign policy"" was, in his view, a direct precursor to Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon's condescending behavior toward his Turkish counterpart this week.""Already when we heard it, we were quite shocked. He said Israeli diplomacy is too soft and it has lost its pride. Many in the community of retired Israeli diplomats feel very ashamed at this, and in particular on what's happened over the past week,"" Dr. Liel says.Earlier this week, Mr. Ayalon had called in Turkey's ambassador to complain about a Turkish television drama that depicts Israeli intelligence agents and diplomats as murderous and cruel. As part of the official talking-to, Ayalon seated Amb. Oguz Celikkol in a visibly lower chair and did not place a Turkish flag as usual on the table along with the Israeli one - and made a point of noting this to the Israeli television crews filming the meeting. There were also no smiles or on-camera handshakes, though there were off-camera, leaving the Turkish ambassador feeling manipulated and insulted.The 'end of the love affair'Though the details of the spat may seem rather picayune, the backstory surrounding them foretells more potential changes in both Israel and Turkey.Ayalon's behavior, according to many Israeli political pundits, clearly came with sanction from Israel's controversial foreign minister. Mr. Lieberman, the head of Israel Beytainu (Israel is Our Home) - a nationalist party whose election platform included a divisive plan to make Israeli Arabs sign a loyalty pledge to maintain their citizenship - began his tenure last year with a rocky start on the world stage. He had an early run-in with neighboring Egypt, and said he would recuse himself from any involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process launched in Annapolis, Maryland, because he thought it was a waste of time.But, Liel adds, the source of the latest crisis is not simply Lieberman's or Ayalon's approach to diplomacy on a world stage where Israel feels itself on the defensive, particularly in the aftermath of the Gaza war that raged at this time last year. Also changed is how Turkey's leaders see their relationship with Israel.""What happened between the two countries in the last 13 months, since December 2008 when the [Gaza] war began, signals the end of the love affair, and we have had a severe crisis going on that went all through 2009. We are deep inside it, it's serious, and I am very worried that we don't have change in 2010, we will see further deterioration,"" Liel says.Why warm ties are coolingIn general, Israel deeply values its relationship with Turkey, its closest Muslim ally. Turkey was the first Muslim country to recognize Israel in 1949. And an underlying sense of friendly relations goes back hundreds of years. When medieval Catholic Spain expelled its Jews in 1492 after the Inquisition, the Turkish sultan invited Jews to settle throughout the Ottoman Empire.In recent decades, Turkey's secular establishment - particularly its military - sought to upgrade the relationship with Israel for strategic purposes, seeing itself at odds with both Sunni Arab and Shiite Iranian fundamentalism. But Turkey's shifting domestic landscape has brought to power a government whose constituency does not support such close ties with the Jewish state. From the outbreak of the intifada in 2000 to the wars in Lebanon and Gaza, the past decade was marred with violent events that turned many average Turks against the alliance with Israel.In addition, the politics of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who came to power in 2002 as head of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), distinctly differ from his predecessors. The party, with strong roots in Islam, inherited the strategic alliance between Turkey and Israel - much of it based on cooperation by the countries' militaries. But the new Turkey, snubbed by the European Union and unsatisfied with the dividends of cooperating with the West, has warmed toward countries in the Muslim world that are at odds with Israel and the US. Tensions have run especially high over Israel's military forays against Lebanon's Hizbullah in 2006 and the Hamas-run Gaza Strip last year.Both wars, which involved significant civilian casualties, have produced a public outcry in Turkey.Erdogan has been one of the Middle East's most vocal critics of Israel in both of these wars. At the same time, Erdogan sees himself as having taken a courageous risk, by working to reopen a channel for negotiations between Syria and Israel. Unofficial talks between Jerusalem and Damascus, achieved with Turkey's help, broke off at the outbreak of the Gaza war last year.""That track was an initiative of Erdogan,"" and an apparent disappointment in Israel. ""What we see now is that his government believes Israel is the side to be blamed for everything, for no progress in the peace process, both in the Israeli-Syrian track, as well as Palestinian,"" Liel says.Turkey looking eastOne of the biggest changes in Israel's perception of Turkey's friendship has been that its seen as moving closer to having warm relations with Iran. This, says analyst Shlomo Brom, a retired brigadier-general from the Israeli army, is accompanied by the fact that Turkey's military is no longer calling all the shots.""Things have changed because there isn't the same perception, as we once did, that we have common enemies. Turkey is no longer looking at Iran as their enemy, as they did then. The Turks are looking at themselves as a bridge between Middle East and the Western world in general, including Israel,"" says Brom, an analyst of regional affairs at Tel Aviv University's National Institute for Strategic Studies.""The Turkish military is still interested in the relationship with Israel, but the power of the military is much less than it used to be. So what we're seeing is adjustment pains,"" he says. ""I'm sure that our minister of defense [Ehud Barak] shares the view that the strategic relationship with Israel is of utmost importance, but I'm not sure the prime minister and other ministers do as well.""Mr. Barak, who puts a premium on strengthening the relationship, is due to visit Turkey on Sunday - a point that caused some Israeli pundits to theorize that Lieberman was trying to sabotage Barak's trip. But the trip is still on, and the fact that Turkish officials said Thursday that they would push forward with a deal to receive Israeli drones in March - despite the diplomatic brouhaha - was a sign that the top military minds in both places still place high value on the relationship. Barak is to meet the Turkish defense and foreign minister, as well as the Turkish military's chief of staff. 172 of 266 DOCUMENTS The Christian Science Monitor September 1, 2010 Wednesday No travel to 'terrorist' countries for Florida state universities: court; A challenge to a 2006 law banning state university-funded travel to countries the US deems sponsors of terrorism was struck down Tuesday. Florida-based international scholars say the decision will disrupt studies. Florida-based international scholars are reacting with disappointment to a federal appeals court ruling that reinstates a ban on state university funding for travel to ""terrorist"" countries, including Cuba. The decision greatly complicates the funding of a range of Florida-based research projects focusing on Cuba and other countries. Analysts say it could undercut existing research efforts, encourage top scholars to leave Florida, and deter others from studying or working at the state's public universities. A three-judge panel of the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that a 2006 state law does not conflict with federal statutes and can be fully implemented. Under Florida's Travel Act, no money that flows through a state university - including grants from private foundations - may be used to organize, direct, or coordinate any activities involving travel to a terrorist state. The state law defines ""terrorist state"" as any country designated by the US State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism. Four countries are currently on the list: Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria. At the time it was passed, the Travel Act was viewed as an attempt by Florida's conservative legislature to further tighten the US boycott of Cuba. It was also seen by some analysts as an effort to shut down the Cuban Research Institute at Miami's Florida International University. Although it is a state law, it relies on a federal government determination of terrorist states to set the scope of the academic travel funding ban. A group of Florida-based scholars challenged the legality of the new measure, arguing in federal court that it must be preempted by federal laws and policies that allow scholars to travel to countries such as Cuba. They said the state's restrictive approach to scholarly travel conflicts with the federal government's more permissive approach. The federal judge agreed with the scholars that Florida could not control the use of private foundation grant money to fund such trips, but the judge upheld the restrictions on use of Florida money for academic travel. On Tuesday, the appeals court reversed the federal judge, ruling that Florida was within its authority to restrict all funding flowing through the state university system. ""This is a very unfortunate ruling. I am terribly saddened by it,"" said Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, which is litigating the case on behalf of the scholars. Simon said they are considering further review. ""I hope this is the last gasp of South Florida anti-Castro politics,"" he said of the state's Travel Act. ""This is a dated political tactic."" The appeals court said the state law's impact on federal law and foreign policy was ""too indirect, minor, incidental, and peripheral to trigger"" federal preemption of the state law. ""No federal statute or regulation expressly requires states to pay for foreign travel for state university employees,"" the decision says. ""No federal law says states cannot differentiate among foreign nations when it comes to spending for academic travel."" Word of the decision spread quickly among Florida-based scholars. ""The implications are really quite devastating,"" says Carmen Diana Deere of the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Florida. ""It means that scholars in Florida cannot use grant funding or federal funding to carry out research in Cuba. It also means people's research programs will be undermined."" She said that Florida-based scholars could still receive a federal license to travel to Cuba for research, but they would have to use their own funds to pay for it. ""It is really sad,"" said Noel Smith of the Institute for Research in Art at Tampa's University of South Florida. She said the ruling puts an end to a series of planned exchange programs between the institute and Cuba. The Cuban Museum of Fine Arts had invited her to organize an exhibition in Cuba. And she was planning a 10-week program for American students to study in Cuba next summer. Both of those programs will now be canceled, she said. Last week, the institute opened a show by Cuban artist Carlos Garaicoa. It will run through December 11. Since the show is already paid for, it won't be canceled. But there may not be any opportunities for similar exchanges in the future, Smith said. Smith said preventing scholars from traveling and studying is counter-productive for Florida and the US. ""The more the people of Cuba get to know us and the more we know Cubans, the better the future is going to be,"" she said. The ban doesn't just disrupt the research of Cuban scholars. Houman Sadri, a political science professor at the University of Central Florida, has just returned from a research trip to Iran. Now he's worried about how he'll pay for his next trip. He says the restriction is counter to America's interest in knowing all it can about places like Iran and organizations like Al-Qaeda. ""My area of specialization is revolutionary states,"" he said. ""With this law I cannot use state funds for research in Iran, Libya, and Cuba - basically all the countries I study."" Professor Sadri added, ""This is my life."" One possible solution for researchers is suggested in the appeals court ruling itself. The judges wrote in a footnote on page seven of the 12-page decision that there are no legal impediments to private research foundations finding a new way to deliver funding to scholars that bypasses the Florida state university system. ""Although grantors may need to modify their grant disbursement and management procedures to work around the Act, the grantors are free to do so; the state is exerting no coercive pressure - economic or otherwise - on the grantors to discourage them from doing so,"" the court said in Footnote 9. 173 of 266 DOCUMENTS August 31, 2010 Tuesday FINAL EDITION America's hand in Middle East peace Since the 1973 Yom Kippur War, U.S. presidents have tried with limited success to help craft peace agreements between Israel and its Arab neighbors. USA TODAY's Richard Wolf looks at some key moments: Jimmy Carter What happened: The Camp David Accords in September 1978 and peace agreement signed in March 1979 ended 30 years of war between Israel and Egypt. Egypt became the first Arab nation to recognize Israel, which in turn withdrew its armed forces from the Sinai Peninsula. Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat won the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1978; Sadat was assassinated in 1981. Ronald Reagan What happened: A violent period with little progress toward peace included Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon in 1982 to suppress Palestinian rocket fire and terrorist incursions. A suicide bomber destroyed the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut in October 1983, killing 241 servicemembers. In 1987, the First Intifada, or Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in Gaza and the West Bank, launched six years of civil unrest. George H.W. Bush What happened: Secretary of State James Baker arranged the first Arab-Israeli peace conference in Madrid in October 1991, following the U.S. victory over Iraq in the Persian Gulf War. The conference was followed by several sets of bilateral talks in Washington, in which Israeli leaders met with those from Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The talks continued for several years but failed to produce concrete agreements. Bill Clinton What happened: The Oslo Accords, signed in Washington in September 1993, included Israel's recognition of the PLO and the PLO's recognition of Israel's right to exist. PLO leader Yasser Arafat returned to the West Bank and established the Palestinian Authority. In October 1994, Israel and Jordan signed a peace treaty. Clinton's major effort at peace was the Camp David summit in July 2000, but Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak couldn't close a deal. George W. Bush What happened: The Quartet -- the United States, Russia, European Union and United Nations -- issued its ""road map"" for peace in 2003, including establishment of a Palestinian state. Bush's major effort was launched in Annapolis, Md., in November 2007, where Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas shook hands before more than 40 invited nations and organizations. Subsequent talks yielded no agreement. Barack Obama 2009-present What happened: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton appointed former Senate majority leader George Mitchell early on as her Middle East envoy. Mitchell, who led successful peace talks in Northern Ireland, has spent 18 months shuttling between the two sides. Obama persuaded Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to come to Washington this Wednesday and Thursday to launch another round of peace talks, with bilateral negotiations to follow."
174,The Atlanta Journal-Constitution,2010-01-03,Five pressing questions to answer in 2010,Main Edition,,Newspapers,,,ENGLISH,NEWS; Pg. 4A,"January 3, 2010",747 words,"Will President Barack Obama regain his momentum? Obama entered the Oval Office almost a year ago with high --- perhaps unrealistic --- expectations. Since then, his approval ratings have plunged amid a variety of complications: public distrust of health care reform; his apparent countenancing of congressional pork-barrel spending amid soaring budget deficits; stubbornly high unemployment despite billions in stimulus funds; conservatives' belittling of his multilateral approach to foreign policy; and liberals' dissatisfaction with his expansion of the war in Afghanistan and failure to deliver on other goals. Even his Nobel Peace Prize drew more jeers than cheers. Some sort of payoff for Obama's efforts --- particularly in the economic arena --- is essential if he is to stop the erosion and live up to his promise of renewed hope. Will Republicans see substantial gains in the mid-term elections? The general unhappiness with Obama and the Democratic-controlled Congress bodes well for Republicans, who are anticipating gains as every House seat, more than a third of the Senate seats and 37 governorships come up for a vote in November. But the GOP faces its own nagging questions: Will its leaders, if they regain power, be able to harness it to the firm resolve that kept Republicans united in the face of overwhelming Democratic majorities? Or will a new generation of conservative politicians, elected with the support of independent-minded voters, become a potentially divisive force --- just as Blue Dog Democrats, strengthened by 2008 victories in swing districts, have frustrated liberal leaders like Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi? Will Iran continue to defy the world --- and its own people? Iran insists it has no plans to build nuclear weapons, but even its staunchest allies --- the Russians --- no longer take the country at its word. Iran has balked at efforts to entice it into a compromise: shipping its uranium outside the country to be enriched for what Iran insists is peaceful use rather than continuing to build its own enrichment capacity, which could produce weapons-grade material as well. Stricter sanctions against Iran could come next. But an apprehensive Israel --- which conducted pre-emptive air strikes on an Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981 and a Syrian installation in 2007 --- could lose patience with the so-far fruitless diplomatic process, threatening the always shaky Mideast peace. At the same time, bloody demonstrations last week served as a reminder that Iranians are anything but united behind the regime. Will its brutally repressive response ultimately undermine its legitimacy with the wider populace? Will the economic recovery generate new jobs? Almost a year after Congress approved a $787 billion stimulus, some aspects of the economy are clearly in better shape. But the unemployment rate remains above 10 percent, and some economists say it is headed even higher. Congress is working on a second stimulus intended to generate the jobs the first one didn't. But with millions of Americans in danger of running out of unemployment benefits, will the help come in time? Or will high unemployment become a long-term problem as record government borrowing pushes up interest rates, making it harder for job-generating businesses to obtain capital? Will the Afghanistan surge work? Torn between those who urged a troop buildup to shore up Afghanistan's government and those who warned he would be committing the country to another Vietnam, Obama chose to send in 30,000 more soldiers. Each argument has its strong points. There is anecdotal evidence that Afghans in sections of the country under Taliban control turned to the rebels not out of opposition to democracy, but because of fear and frustration. Given a chance, elected civil government can regain their support, surge backers argue. The other side contends that the corruption-riddled Afghan government is the equivalent of the weak Thieu regime in South Vietnam, which collapsed once U.S. aid was withdrawn --- and that the West's real fight is not against the Taliban in Afghanistan, but al-Qaida across the border in Pakistan. Will Obama, as he contended in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, demonstrate that ""we ... can bend history in the direction of justice""? Or will Afghanistan, in the words of Gen. Omar Bradley as he warned against extending the Korean conflict to China, prove to be ""the wrong war, at the wrong place, at the wrong time, against the wrong enemy""?"

The Arab Middle East is the least democratic region in the world and it is getting worse, according to Freedom House's latest report. Only Morocco, Kuwait and Lebanon now pass as ""partly free"" while Yemen, Bahrain and have this year regressed into the same ""not free"" group as all the other Arab states. Jordan's relegation is particularly alarming. 's decision to barely two years into its term, and delay fresh elections until late 2010 by Freedom House as ""an attempt to manipulate the political process"" and a decline in political rights. In spite of this, Jordan retains a carefully fashioned friendly image in the west and remains a key US regional ally, with Abdullah becoming the Obama's White House in April last year. With US strategy under Obama seemingly shifting from democracy promotion towards stability-focused realism, is Amman's backsliding the shape of things to come? Is Jordan's friendly-faced ""autocracy lite"" the best that democracy advocates can hope for? For decades Jordan has been viewed by the west as the best of a bad bunch in the Arab world. During the cold war the late King Hussein's pro-American autocratic rule was deemed more benevolent than that of his neighbours in Syria, Iraq and Egypt, and hopes were high for the democratic reforms he initiated in 1989. Since then, Jordan has had an elected parliament with quotas for women, a partly independent press, increased civil society and cooperation with NGOs. It also legalised the Jordanian wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamic Action Front (IAF). Adding the shine to this friendly image have been the half-British King Abdullah and his glamorous Palestinian , darlings of the western media for their support for charities, progressive values and tolerance. Yet beneath the kingdom's glossy surface lies an autocratic underbelly. Despite economic liberalisation, the political reforms of the early 1990s have stalled. While Abdullah , domestic supporters have grown frustrated at his inability or unwillingness to push reform past Jordan's entrenched elites. No were permitted during the 2007 elections, amid recurring claims that electoral boundaries were re-drawn to ensure a pro-regime result, particularly at the expense of Jordan's under-represented Palestinian majority. Even this engineered parliament had , with the king legally able to rule for long periods without it. Furthermore, strict laws muted the fledgling independent press and Jordan recently slipped behind Egypt in its . Human Rights Watch of regular prisoner abuse and of governors to detain people without trial. The Obama administration, however, seems unconcerned by this creeping autocracy. Washington recently allocated an in annual assistance to the Hashemite kingdom, at the same time as Congress cut democracy and governance aid for Egypt and Jordan. Though the White House has spoken of in Jordan, notably in education, refugees and the assimilation of Palestinians, it also sees the benefits in continued support for undemocratic rule. Obama needs a consistent ally to fight his corner should he redouble his efforts in mediating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in 2010, and won't want to risk the instability of forcing reform. Furthermore, Washington of Jordan's Intelligence Directorate, recently highlighted by the of CIA operatives in Afghanistan. Such services thrive on the unaccountability of autocracy. The EU has proven equally reluctant to hold Jordan to account. Indeed, that Jordan's ""strong commitment"" to the social and economic reforms required as part of its Association Agreement are deemed sufficient to continue financial support despite the lack of progress in political and electoral reforms. It appears that western reluctance to promote and support Arab democracy is still shaped by George Bush's failures. Bush's aggressive attempts to democratise the Middle East were unpopular, ineffective and hypocritical. While some have noted improvements in Lebanon and Iraq as a result of Bush's ""freedom agenda"", the Bush administration also oversaw in Egypt and the subversion of democracy in the Palestinian Territories. Keen to rebuild America's image in the region after such disasters, Obama has adopted a more restrained approach. But Obama should not abandon the cause just because Bush's method was flawed. Opposing regime change should not mean opposing regime improvement. Jordan has shown a willingness to reform in the past and should be actively encouraged to do so again. Both the US and EU have vast reserves of soft power that they seem reluctant to use in promoting democratic change, most notably the huge sums of aid sent to Amman each year. Jordan has an internal reform movement upon which to focus and a seemingly progressive leader. If Jordan, with this potential and reliance on western aid, cannot halt its democratic decline, what hope for the more authoritarian Arab states?"
176,Guardian.com,2010-06-03,Gaza flotilla: What should Obama do?,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"June 3, 2010",677 words,"Michael Tomasky: It is tempting to say the US should express furious moral outrage over Israel's raid of the Gaza flotilla - but that is not its role What should the United States be doing in response to Israel's flotilla raid? It's tempting to say that it should be expressing furious moral outrage. If it can't express outrage at Israel over this, then when will it, Arabs and others might ask. It's a fair question. The Obama administration certainly pays a price for not doing that - with Turkey particularly in this instance, since (at least) four citizens of this also-crucial ally were slain by the IDF, and across the region more generally. I'd have little doubt that from Istanbul and Damascus and Riyadh and Hezbollah's south Lebanon stronghold, Obama appears weak and unfair. And it's not just that the administration has lacked outrage. Let's be plain. It has defended Israel in ways no other country would right now. At the UN security council, the US blocked a forceful anti-Israel resolution and shepherded the passage of one that . Even this wasn't really enough by the standards of powerful American Jewish interest groups. The Jewish Telegraphic Agency, always worth reading during times like this, that Aipac and other groups were pushing for a more pro-Israel line from the administration (""Groups want stronger US defense of Israel, Obama not obliging,"" ran the headline). The piece also quoted Elliott Abrams, the hard-line Israel hawk who was in the previous administration, as saying that the Obama team should have blocked any resolution at all. The administration was undoubtedly getting these messages, because last night, . Again : ""Biden said Israel has an 'absolute right' to defend its security interests, according to a transcript Politico obtained of an interview that was to be broadcast Wednesday evening on the Charlie Rose show on Bloomberg TV. ""'It's legitimate for Israel to say, ""I don't know what's on that ship. These guys are dropping eight - 3,000 rockets on my people,""' Biden said."" The current administration has a very different Middle East policy from its predecessor. But there is one constant, like it or not. The United States is not going to denounce Israel's actions in starkly moral terms. That just isn't its role. What is? Keeping the recently started proximity talks going, and retaining the credibility to try to push both parties (we should really say all three parties, since Fatah and Hamas are so dramatically divergent now) toward more reasonable positions. On the first point, so far so good. Despite all the incendiary rhetoric flying around, the talks are continuing. , and Netanyahu will see him today. Abbas will be in Washington next week, and all signs are that Netanyahu will soon reschedule the visit with Obama that he cancelled in the wake of the raid. On the second point, well, as usual, who knows. The administration has now, as of this morning, stepped out more publicly (albeit ) as saying that the blockade has to end. As Martin Indyk notes in , the first order of business here for Obama, Mitchell and Hillary Clinton would be to try and strike a deal to make that happen: lifting the siege in return for agreed-upon inspection regimes and the release of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. It just might be (emphasis on might) that the flotilla incident, so widely questioned and denounced within Israel, has perversely given new life to that possibility. Diplomacy is at best unsexy and slow. At its worst, involving intransigent forces such as Likud and Hamas, it has all the allure of watching slugs mate. But diplomacy is the US's job here. The high moral outrage is necessary, but it's the job of others. · Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight"
177,Guardian.com,2010-07-09,Foreign Office takes down blog praising late Hezbollah mentor,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"July 9, 2010",597 words,"Ambassador to Lebanon called Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah a 'decent' man and said world needed more like him Britain has moved to quash a row over its Middle East policy by taking down by its ambassador in Beirut praising the late , a staunchly anti-American cleric who was a mentor for Lebanon's Hezbollah. Frances Guy had commented in her blog - on the Foreign Office website - that Fadlallah's death was sad news, calling the religious leader a decent man and saying that ""the world needs more men like him"". The ambassador's post came to light as , Octavia Nasr, who had tweeted her regret at Fadlallah's demise. Nasr's case highlighted issues of freedom of expression, social media and the speed of response in the digital age - as well as the political sensitivities attached to the militant Lebanese Islamist movement. William Hague, the foreign secretary, ordered the ambassador's offending item removed yesterday. The Guardian has learned that Britain also downgraded its diplomatic representation at Fadlallah's funeral in Beirut on Tuesday, sending just a second secretary. France and Italy were represented by their ambassadors. Guy's comments drew outrage in Israel, where a foreign ministry spokesman said Fadlallah had inspired suicide bombings. The British ambassador had to decide ""whether promoting terror and giving it religious justification can be considered a heritage to be cherished"", Yigal Palmor was quoted as saying. In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said today that Guy's post had been removed ""after mature consideration"". Diplomats' blogs, which flourished under Hague's digitally aware Labour predecessor, David Miliband, may be more closely vetted in future. Fadlallah was as a key figure in the founding of Hezbollah after Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982, but both he and the group denied he was its spiritual leader. The Iraqi-born cleric was revered as one of Shia Islam's highest religious authorities and won support from many Muslims for his anti-American stance and his support for the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran. But he condemned the 9/11 terrorist attacks and held relatively progressive views on the role of women in society - one of the reasons cited by Nasr for her respect for him. Britain has a more nuanced view of Hezbollah than the US and Israel, though it has proscribed the military wing as a terrorist organisation. Hezbollah is thought to have been behind a spate of suicide bomb attacks on US forces and kidnappings of westerners, including Terry Waite and John McCarthy, in the 1980s, though it has denied involvement. Its forces still confront Israel, and the movement, backed by Iran and Syria, has replenished its arsenal since the 2006 war. But British diplomats, including Guy, have contacts with its MPs in the Lebanese parliament, and with local officials in south Lebanon. Guy's obituary described Fadlallah as the politician in Lebanon she enjoyed meeting most. ""When you visited him you could be sure of a real debate, a respectful argument and you knew you would leave his presence feeling a better person,"" she wrote. ""That for me is the real effect of a true man of religion; leaving an impact on everyone he meets, no matter what their faith."" Palmor was quoted as saying: ""Sheikh Fadlallah was behind hostage-taking, suicide bombings and other sorts of wanton violence, but Ambassador Guy said he was a man of peace, and Ambassador Guy is an honourable woman."""
178,The Globe and Mail (Canada),2010-05-06,Britain's election goes global as project lets U.K. electors donate their votes,,,Transcript,,SHIRA HERZOG,ENGLISH,COMMENT; Pg. A21,"October 6, 2010",270 words,"British voters may have a tough time choosing among the country's three main parties as they head to the polls on Thursday, but Kabul resident Khaliq Haidary has already made up his mind. He's cast his vote for Conservative Party Leader David Cameron. ""He had an emphasis on putting a new strategy in external policy on Afghanistan,"" said Mr. Haidary, 28, who runs a telecom services business in the Afghan capital by day and is a political science student by night. He made up his mind after watching the man he calls ""Mr. David"" in the televised debates. Mr. Haidary is not dreaming. He's taken part in Give Your Vote, an unusual initiative that asked Britons to donate their votes to people in Afghanistan, Ghana and Bangladesh, allowing those who are influenced by British foreign policy to have a say. Citizens of those countries have studied party leaders' views on global issues. ""We tend to forget that big, big decisions on climate change, war, trade are made utterly undemocratically,"" said James Sadri, one of the founders of Egality, the social activist network that conceived the idea. ""We need to democratize those decisions."" Afghans, Bangladeshis and Ghanaians taking part put forth questions about global issues, which volunteers in Britain posed to politicians from the three main parties. The responses were translated into the local languages for broadcast on radio, TV and online. To help make up their minds, some foreign voters also watched the three televised debates featuring Labour candidate and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Tory Leader Cameron and Liberal Democratic Leader Nick Clegg. Mr. Haidary and others sent their votes by text message or e-mail to the organizers, who sent them Wednesday to British vote donors such as Anna Llewellyn. She had been planning to vote for the perennially third-place Liberal Democrats. But she received a text message on Wednesday night asking her to vote for Labour on behalf of Emmanuel from Accra, Ghana, who thinks the party has a good record on development. She said Emmanuel's personalized message was ""really moving,"" which made the request to vote for another party easier to swallow. So did the fact that the request wasn't for the Conservatives, whose value system is ""fundamentally opposed"" to her own, she said. ""People are apathetic. They don't get a chance to vote on issues they care about, like climate change,"" said Ms. Llewellyn, a 28-year-old TV producer who lives in south London. ""This really gets my imagination going. It makes me feel like [my] vote counts."" Mr. Sadri said he came up with the idea for Give Your Vote while living in Syria in 2008. He and his Iraqi roommates were watching a U.S. presidential debate in which John McCain and Barack Obama were debating American military strategy in Iraq. ""My housemates had different opinions - some wanted the troops out, some wanted them to stay - but they weren't being asked,"" Mr. Sadri said. ""This is an open-source idea,"" Mr. Sadri said. ""If you feel passionately that these issues you care about aren't being dealt with ... give your vote to somebody over there."" 179 of 266 DOCUMENTS The Globe and Mail (Canada) September 22, 2010 Wednesday Why the one-year deadline on Mideast talks matters sherzog@globeandmail.com The latest round of Israeli-Palestinian talks was launched with the dubious announcement that a comprehensive agreement would be reached in a year. After all, in 17 years of Israeli-Palestinian talks, no other deadline has been met, and already, the crisis over Israel's settlement construction freeze throws the timeline into sharp relief. But while appearing unrealistic, the framework was established for good reason. The three principals have individual clocks ticking and together, they share the grave realization that a year from now the Middle East won't be the same. From day one in office, U.S. President Barack Obama has been seized with forging a new Mideast constellation that starts with Israeli-Palestinian peace - but now he's only got a year before launching his re-election campaign. Domestic political realities will then make it more difficult for him to be perceived as pressuring Israel, while if successful, he'll be able to campaign with a momentous foreign policy achievement. For Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, a deal is key to the survival of his already divided Fatah faction. Otherwise, Fatah will lose its primacy, making it easier for Hamas leaders to deride their rivals as hostages to Israeli and American dictates. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu knows that in a year, the deadline for Palestinian prime minister Salam Fayyad's two-year plan (announced in August 2009) to create the physical, institutional and administrative infrastructure for a Palestinian state will expire. Mr. Fayyad, whose plan is vigorously backed by Western governments, will then seek international support at the UN or the European Union for the establishment of a state. For Mr. Netanyahu, it's far better to have an agreement in place than to react to an external initiative. All of these are reason enough to ""get to yes,"" but the compelling, joint imperative is the Iranian connection. If in the past, U.S. and Israeli intelligence assessments differed on the timing of Iran's capability to assemble nuclear weapons, they now agree that the horizon is about 12 months. Starkly put, this means that in a year, the Middle East will change dramatically - either because of Iran's capacity or the damaging aftermath of a pre-emptive attack. Former American secretary of state Colin Powell recently noted that ""the stars are not lining up for a U.S. or Israeli attack."" But diplomacy and sanctions may also not have the desired impact. The perilous option of living with a nuclear Iran is now on the table. Mr. Obama rightly believes that by removing the irritant of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (and possibly brokering a deal with Syria) and triggering the Arab League's peace initiative, he'll neutralize the historic Arab-Israeli conflict, thereby bolstering a Sunni coalition as a regional shield against Iran's power projection. It's too early to tell if Iran can actually be deterred, but the President knows that in the alternative, Israel will require iron-clad guarantees not unlike NATO's Article 5, which provides protection for any member state against an armed attack. Although Mr. Netanyahu's true intentions on the Palestinian portfolio remain unknown, he's at the table because he buys the linkage. He came to office pledging to prevent Iran's military nuclear capability and hoping to obtain a U.S. nod for what might be drastic military action. Recognizing this may not be in the cards is all the more reason not to alienate the American President. Even Israel Harel, a veteran leader of the settler movement, now reluctantly acknowledges that if Mr. Netanyahu plays the Iran card and demonstrates American security guarantees to save Israeli lives in return for far-reaching concessions, he'll undercut fervent ideological and religious opposition on the right. Still, it's easy to be skeptical. At his Global Initiative this week, Bill Clinton put the chances of an Israeli-Palestinian deal at no better than 50-50. In a sober assessment of Israel's strategic challenges in 2011, analysts at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies doubt if direct talks can lead to a comprehensive agreement. Mr. Obama's got a different stick for each of the sides: For Israel, it's the security protection he can offer against Iran; for the Palestinians, it's assistance and legitimization for state-building efforts. And eventually, if the U.S. President won't settle for half measures, it may take an American plan to meet the timeline. 180 of 266 DOCUMENTS BBC Monitoring Former Soviet Union - Political Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring October 6, 2010 Wednesday Russia, Egypt express concern over Israeli settlements Text of press release ""Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov speaks to Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmad Abu-al-Ghayt by telephone"" published in English by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website on 1 October A telephone conversation took place on 30 September between Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Arab Republic of Egypt Ahmad Abu-al-Ghayt. During their conversation they reviewed in detail the Middle East peace process, taking into account the seriously aggravated situation in Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. Lavrov and Abu-al-Ghayt expressed deep concern over Israel's reluctance to extend the moratorium on settlement activity in the occupied West Bank. They exchanged views on possible ways to overcome the existing situation in order to preserve the negotiating process. In this regard, the Egyptian minister briefed on preparations for an Arab Peace Initiative Follow-up Committee meeting and an emergency Arab League summit. Various options for international efforts to help maintain the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue were also discussed. The heads of the foreign affairs agencies of Russia and Egypt welcomed the recent contacts in Damascus between leaders of Palestinian factions Fatah and Hamas and the accords reached there, expressing the hope for a speedy resolution of the differences still outstanding and the achievement of inter-Palestinian reconciliation.

They discussed the latest developments in Palestine, including efforts to bring stalled peace talks back on track and stressed the need for the global community to renew its commitment to establish an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. Chief of General Intelligence Prince Muqrin and Deputy Commander of the National Guard for Executive Affairs Prince Miteb bin Abdullah received Abbas on his arrival at the Riyadh Air Base. Palestine's Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Jamal Al-Shubaki told Arab News that during the three-hour summit, King Abdullah offered his full support to the Palestinians and said the issue was central to Saudi foreign policy. ""The president explained to the king the situation in Palestinian territories and the present status of peace efforts. The two leaders also stressed the significance of joint Arab efforts in the face of Israel's stubbornness."" Al-Shubaki added that discussions also explored other options such as going to the UN Security Council to find a just solution to the Palestinian issue. Abbas was accompanied by Secretary to the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Yasser Abed Rabbo, chief Palestinian negotiator and member of the PLO Executive Committee Saeb Erekat and media adviser to the president Nabil Abu Rudainah. The last visit by Abbas to the Kingdom was in August, before direct talks between Palestinians and Israel began. Direct US-brokered peace negotiations between the Palestinian [National] Authority and Israel began Sept. 2, but the Palestinians suspended talks after a 10-month Israeli moratorium on housing in Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank expired Sept. 26. The Kingdom supports Arab and international efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive Middle East peace, which would ensure the Palestinians' right to an independent state. The Saudi Council of Ministers urged the United Nations on Oct. 4 to force Israel to abide by international law and Security Council Resolutions and restore the usurped rights of the Palestinians. Saudi Arabia has also stressed the need for national unity between the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah. Relations between Hamas-controlled Gaza and the Fatah-controlled West Bank were severed after Hamas routed and ousted pro-Abbas forces in deadly fighting in Gaza in 2007. The latest meeting scheduled to patch up differences between Hamas and Fatah factions in Damascus on Wednesday was postponed. Source: Arab News website, Jedda, in English 23 Oct 10"

183,The West Australian (Perth),2010-07-22,It's time we had a white paper on human rights; CYNTHIA BANHAM,First Edition,,Newspaper,HIGHLIGHT: ANALYSIS,"HILARY LEILA KRIEGER, Jerusalem Post correspondent",ENGLISH,NEWS; Pg. 2,"February 2, 2010",828 words,"Australian diplomats appeared at a session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva in early May to dispense some friendly advice to Kiribati and Lesotho. In Australia's opinion, neither country was doing enough on the home front to protect human rights. Australia recommended Kiribati should ensure human rights are afforded full legal protection. As for Lesotho, the African nation needed, among other things, to incorporate various international human rights instruments into domestic law. This was two weeks after Australia dumped plans to introduce a Bill of Rights. Strange how Australia feels so free to go around telling other nations what they should be doing on human rights, yet has an aversion to cementing any of the same rights that Australians hold dear into law. But foreign policy is an area where you are always going to find glaring examples of hypocrisy. Climate change is a standout. In 2007, prime minister Kevin Rudd told the world Australia was well positioned to solve climate change problems. Australia would bridge the gap between developed and developing countries, he declared. Two-and-a-half years later, Australia is without even a solution to its own climate change problem, having abandoned plans for an emissions trading scheme. Mr Rudd's successor, Julia Gillard, is a relative novice to the realm of international affairs. The signs so far have not been promising. Her first foray into foreign policy was to announce that East Timor was being lined up as Australia's new offshore refugee processing centre, yet she had not even consulted that country's Prime Minister. For what it's worth, here is some friendly advice on how Australia might take a more consistent and principled approach in the area of international human rights policy. Let's start with Guantanamo Bay, the prison established by the Bush administration in Cuba after the September 11 terrorist attacks, so as to be outside the reach of US law. Its existence, and the human rights abuses that have occurred there, have done great damage to the moral authority of the US. President Barack Obama has promised to shut it, though that is proving difficult to pull off. According to Human Rights Watch, the US holds 181 detainees at Guantanamo Bay. The Obama administration intends to prosecute just 36 of them. It is trying to find countries willing to take the rest. Many have been there for nine years, without charge, without seeing a courtroom. Two weeks ago Germany, under pressure from the US, agreed to accept two Guantanamo Bay detainees for resettlement. Germany joins other countries, including France, Spain, Portugal, Albania, and Bulgaria, that are willing to help resettle detainees who have never been charged. In the past, Australia has refused US requests to resettle detainees but it may be time to reconsider its position. Australia was a great supporter of Guantanamo Bay and its shameful military commission trials, including that of David Hicks. Don't we, as an ally of the US in the so-called war on terror, have a moral responsibility to help Mr Obama close it? Then there is the torture issue. Britain's new Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron announced that his country would hold a judicial inquiry into the role its agents played in the torture of its citizens and residents in the war on terror. That comes a few years after Canada held its own judge-led inquiries into the torture of its citizens. Most notable was the inquiry completed in 2006 into the year-long torture of the dual Canadian-Syrian citizen Maher Arar, whom the Americans rendered that is, abducted and turned over to Syria on false Canadian intelligence in 2002. Australia, too, has a citizen who was detained in the war on terror, turned over by the Americans to Egypt, where he says he was tortured, before being sent to Guantanamo Bay. There has been no judicial inquiry into what happened to Mamdouh Habib, into what if anything Australian agents knew about his treatment. Why not? What is stopping Australia from calling an inquiry, like Britain and Canada have done? If all that seems too hard, there is something else a returned Ms Gillard or a new Abbott government could do to repair Australia's human rights credentials. There have been calls, such as from the Human Rights Law Resource Centre in Melbourne, for Australia to develop a white paper on human rights, which would clearly set out the central role that human rights plays or should play in Australian foreign policy. Other countries have them, including the Netherlands, which made public its human rights strategy for foreign policy in 2007. Such a paper would promote a principled, consistent, coherent and concrete approach to human rights in foreign affairs and in Australia's international relations, Phil Lynch, the executive director of the Human Rights Law Resource Centre, said. A white paper would set parameters for our foreign policy makers, it would guide our future foreign policy decisions and it would send an unambiguous message to the world about the value that Australia places on human rights. Wouldn't that be a change? Cynthia Banham is the diplomatic correspondent for the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. She is also a visiting fellow/journalist in residence at the International Relations Department of the Australian National University. 184 of 266 DOCUMENTS The Jerusalem Post January 29, 2010 Friday Just 10 minutes on foreign policy, terrorism in State of the Union. It's economic issues that people care about, says US int'l affairs expert Michael Mandelbaum WASHINGTON - It is telling that US President Barack Obama's first two utterances of the term ""national security"" on Wednesday night came as he was explaining to Americans his plans to expand exports and freeze discretionary spending without jeopardizing their safety. That's because the overwhelming focus of Obama's first State of the Union address - the annual pilgrimage the US president makes to Capitol Hill to lay out his policy priorities to Congress and the American people - was on domestic issues. His top concern was clearly the economy, with jobs, financial reform, tax cuts, and even education, energy and healthcare presented through this prism. In comparison, he spent no more than 10 minutes of his 70-minute discourse on foreign policy and terrorism. Even several of the countries and regions that were mentioned - Europe, China, India - came in comparisons to America's own trade and infrastructure undertakings. The Middle East peace process wasn't mentioned once. This was a State of the Union focused heavily on the Union - both the internal workings of the United States itself and an attempt to bring the parties and people together. The new initiatives were all domestic - a high- speed rail system, small business benefits, the budget freeze - and reflected Americans' concerns about their economic well-being and Obama's concern about his political well-being. The speech came a week after a major Republican upset in a special Massachusetts election cost Obama his 60-vote, filibuster-proof majority in the US Senate, threatening the passage of his signature health care reform bill and reflecting approval ratings that have dropped below 50 percent. The State of the Union address, by several accounts, was revised in light of the Massachusetts loss, and American foreign policy expert Michael Mandelbaum noted that the White House made an assessment that the economy was the public's consuming worry. ""That's what people care about,"" said Mandelbaum, who described the speech as ""notable for how little attention there was to foreign policy issues."" And as the speech lays out the principle program of the president, Mandelbaum said, ""That tells you whatever political capital and energy the administration has is going to be devoted to domestic and not international issues."" Such a situation is in contrast to the previous administration of George W. Bush, which was largely defined by its actions abroad and which devoted much of its State of the Union planning to foreign issues. Beyond Iraq, Afghanistan and Iran, one political Web site found that Bush referred to Israel and Syria six times each in State of the Union addresses, and Palestine and Lebanon 16 and 10 times respectively. Mandelbaum, an American foreign policy professor at Johns Hopkins' School of Advanced International Studies, pointed to Obama's disappointments in the Middle East as another reason he would be disinclined to focus on the region in his prime-time address. Indeed, just last week, Obama gave an interview to Time magazine in which he said ""it is absolutely true that what we did this year didn't produce the kind of breakthrough that we wanted"" between Israelis and Palestinians. All of which points to a decreased attention to the Arab-Israeli conflict. On the other hand, Obama referred to Iran in two separate places - more than almost any other foreign actor - and used some of his strongest rhetoric in threatening that its leaders would face ""growing consequences"" for rebuffing international calls to halt its nuclear program. ""It should be reassuring to those who think that Iran is important that the president and whoever helped him put together [the speech] concluded that they could not afford not to mention it,"" noted Mandelbaum, but added that the brief reference came too late in the address (at more than an hour in) for it to be seen as a major part of the message delivered Wednesday night. ""If you look at the whole foreign policy section, it is clear that it was all a placeholder. They simply didn't want to make any news about foreign policy on any front,"" assessed Robert Kagan, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. On Wednesday morning, Kagan made an appeal in The Washington Post for Obama to shift his support decisively behind the Iranian opposition to try to undercut the regime, calling for the president to take advantage of his ""tear down this wall"" moment. That didn't happen when the president took the podium hours later, as he added only ""we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of Iran"" in a paragraph devoted to American ideals to his earlier warning over Teheran's nuclear program. ""On the one hand, I'm disappointed he didn't say more, or even repeat his earlier positive statements in support of the Iranian opposition,"" Kagan said. ""But I'm reluctant to read too much into it, because he didn't say anything serious or interesting about any area of foreign policy."""
185,The Jerusalem Post,2010-03-18,Could Brazil be a player in the Middle East process?,,,Newspaper,"HIGHLIGHT: Since early 2009, it seems that the country, and President Lula da Silva personally, have embarked on an active diplomatic offensive in the Middle East, centered around Iran's international position. The writer is Senior Research Scholar at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) and The Institute for Policy and Strategy (IPS) at The Interdisciplinary Center (IDC), Herzliya, Israel. This article first appeared in the Brazilian daily O Estado do Sao Paolo on Wednesday.",,ENGLISH,OPINION; Pg. 16,"March 23, 2010",1060 words,"President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is the first Brazilian head of state to visit the Holy Land since Emperor Dom Pedro II in 1876, a great event indeed for both Israel and Brazil. He is also visiting the Palestinian Authority and Jordan. Since early 2009, it seems that Brazil, and President da Silva personally, have taken on an active diplomatic offensive in the Middle East, centered around Iran's international position. After a failed attempt at a visit in May, due to elections constraints, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became the first Iranian president to visit Brazil in November 2009. Despite American, and even internal, criticism concerning Brazil's lenient view on Iran's nuclear program as well as the disputed presidential elections, da Silva has warmly welcomed Ahmadinejad, claiming that the two countries can cooperate to enhance a new economic order. In the face of Iran's successful push in Latin America, the Israeli diplomatic corps has finally rediscovered the continent. Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman visited Brazil in July 2009, followed by President Shimon Peres in November, the first visit of an Israeli President in 40 years. Coincidence or not, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was also invited in November. It seems therefore that da Silva has taken these opportunities to involve Brazil in the Middle East process and to perhaps act as a mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well as US-Iranian relations. THIS DIPLOMATIC push fits Brazil's enhanced regional and global standing, its membership in the BRIC Club (Brazil, Russia, India and China), its desire for a permanent seat on the Security Council and da Silva's personal ambition to play a more international role. This move was facilitated by US President Barack Obama's new strategy of openness toward Iran and the Muslim world. Da Silva was the first Latin American leader hosted by Obama, who hailed him as ""the most popular politician on earth."" On the other hand, da Silva's relationship with Iran has been described as conflicting with Western policies aimed at isolating and sanctioning Iran for its controversial nuclear project. Brazil has, by and large, supported the Iranian nuclear program, and the president considers Iran to have the right to develop peaceful nuclear technology, provided that it does not violate international regulations. During the visits of Middle Eastern politicians in Brazil, da Silva has stressed the importance of searching for peace in the region by means of dialogue rather than isolation, and showed his determination to engage in Middle East affairs. ""The time has come to bring into the arena players who will be able to put forward new ideas. Those players must have access to all levels of the conflict: in Israel, in Palestine, in Iran, in Syria, in Jordan and in many other countries that are associated with this conflict"" da Silva told Haaretz just before his arrival. WHAT THEN are the issues at stake and what are the chances Brazil can play a major role in the negotiating process in the region? Concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mahmoud Abbas declared during his visit: ""With respect to you, President Lula, we would like you to have a role [in the Middle East], and you're ready for it. Brazil, as an important country, and President Lula, as a respected leader, can play an important role. There are many ways of taking action for peace."" Interestingly, Abbas's main request to da Silva was to convince Iran to put an end to its support for the radical Palestinian movement Hamas. ""Iran supports Hamas with money and Hamas' decisions are in the hands of Teheran,"" he said in an interview before his arrival. Days ago, Mahmoud Abbas blamed Iran for thwarting reconciliation between his Fatah faction and Hamas. Iran doesn't want Hamas to sign the Egyptian-brokered reconciliation document, Abbas said, and argued that the Palestinians should be ""free from Iranian tutelage."" It could inferred from this that Abbas will once again ask President Lula to intervene with the Iranians during his May visit to Teheran. Abbas will also probably prepare the ground for future support from Brazil should negotiations with Israel fail and the Palestinian Authority decide to make a unilateral declaration of Palestinian sovereignty. As for the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, Abbas, the Israeli leaders as well as some skeptic observers, believe that Brazil has a rather ""modest diplomatic realm in the region."" They are betting mainly on US mediation and are already overwhelmed by the meddling of some already major players, like Egypt, Europeans and other well-wishers worldwide. THE ISRAELI government would have most probably insisted in its dialogue with the Brazilian president on a more assertive stance on the Iranian nuclear issue, seen as an existential threat to the Jewish state, especially against the backdrop of Brazil's decision not to support the proposed sanctions against Iran at the Security Council and da Silva's recent declaration that ""there are other interests in the Middle East which must be represented ... Iran is part of all this, and therefore someone must talk to them."" At least on the issue of Ahmadinejad's Holocaust denial and threats to destroy Israel, da Silva has presented a clear stance: ""It's impossible to imagine someone saying there wasn't a Holocaust or to accept someone saying they're going to do away with another country,"" da Silva said before his departure to the region. It seems Ahmadinejad hadn't heard Lula; he declared two days later that Israel ""had reached the end of its road"" and was no longer ""useful for its masters [the West]"" who had ""gathered the most criminal people in the world and stationed them in our region with lies and fabricated scenarios."" Thus, ironically, on the political and diplomatic side, da Silva's visit to Israel, the PA and Jordan will be focused mostly on the Iranian issue. Hopefully, the Brazilian president will understand that his country's stance is extremely important in the global arena, and that he should strive to help stop the nuclearization of the radical Iranian regime: for the sake of the stability of our beleaguered region, the advance of the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, the internal reconciliation between Palestinian themselves and for the well-being of the oppressed Iranian people."
186,The Jerusalem Post,2010-04-15,From our Archives,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,FEATURES; Pg. 14,"April 18, 2010",443 words,"On April 15, 1945, The Palestine Post reported that the Allied entry into Berlin was imminent, as the Wehrmacht's troops were crumpling up. The Americans crossed the Elbe River and were 60 miles southwest of Berlin. Big German cities were falling one after another. The train bearing the body of President Roosevelt arrived in Washington and then left to his last resting place in the rose garden of his country house at Hyde Park. No change in US foreign policy was expected and it was believed that the new president, Harry Truman, would steer right of center. Roosevelt's death was received with profound regret in Palestine, where he was regarded as a great friend of the Jewish people. The Soviet Communist Party daily Pravda severely criticized the Soviet Jewish writer and war correspondent Ilya Ehrenburg's views on the German people's guilt in this war. According to George Alexandrov, chief of the Communist Party's Press and Propaganda Department, only Nazis were guilty. Foreign observers noted the extreme importance of Alexadrov's view as indicating a firm future Soviet policy on German guilt, as coming dirrectly from the Kremlin. On April 15, 1960, The Jerusalem Post was told in New York that the Seafarers' International Union ""will continue to picket the Cleopatra and other United Arab Republic [composed of Egypt and Syria] ships that tie up in port until the UAR lifts the embargo on American ships that touch Israeli ports."" Such boycott of UAR ships in German ports was also to be considered by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions meeting in Hamburg. According to a UN report the four Israelis, kidnapped by Lebanese forces inside Israeli territory, were kept in a Beirut prison. An investigation continued, while the Lebanese held that the four were some 80 meters within their territory and turned down Israel's request to see or speak with them. Standing in the shadow of a sixth-century arch, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion visited the reconstructed Byzantine acropolis at Avdat. On April 15, 1985, The Jerusalem Post reported that all heavy Israeli army equipment had already been removed from Lebanon. Prime Minister Shimon Peres said that Israel was seeking a ""package deal"" with Egypt to resolve various differences. Minister without Portfolio Ezer Weizman arrived in Egypt and met President Hosni Mubarak. Israeli missile boats got a new, more avanced radar system. The US extradited John Demjanuk, suspected of being ""Ivan the Terrible"" in the Nazi extermination camps, to Israel for trial. The salaries of ministers, Knesset members and judges were raised by from 23 percent to 34%."
187,Sydney Morning Herald (Australia),2010-12-07,Brazil angers US and Israel with its pro-Palestine move,First Edition,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,NEWS AND FEATURES; International News; Pg. 8,"December 6, 2010",565 words,"US politicians condemned Brazil's ""severely misguided"" and ""regrettable"" decision to recognise a Palestinian state. Brazil's decision ""is regrettable and will only serve to undermine peace and security in the Middle East,"" said Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Ms Ros-Lehtinen will chair the panel from January when the new Congress sits. She said ""responsible nations"" should wait until Palestinians return to direct talks with Israel and recognise its ""right to exist as a Jewish state"", before taking such a step. A Democrat, Eliot Engel, chairman of the House subcommittee overseeing relations with Latin America, condemned Brazil's move. ""Brazil's decision to recognise Palestine is severely misguided and represents a last gasp by a Lula-led foreign policy which was already substantially off track,"" Mr Engel said. ""Brazil is sending a message to the Palestinians that they need not make peace to gain recognition as a sovereign state."" Mr Lula da Silva's decision, announced in a public letter to Mahmoud Abbas, his Palestinian counterpart, is the latest evidence of Brazil's growing interest in the politics of the Middle East. In recent years, Brazil has been involved in unofficial ""back channel"" negotiations between Israel and Syria. In March, Mr Lula da Silva also became the first Brazilian leader officially to visit the Holy Land. The trip was not without its controversies. The Israeli Foreign Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, refused to meet Mr Lula da Silva after he laid a wreath at Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's grave and then turned down an invitation to lay a wreath at the grave of Theodor Herzl, the father of modern political Zionism. Mr Lula da Silva's bid to reach out to Iran, which he visited in May after hosting President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has also raised concerns in the US and Israel. Brazil and Turkey voted against a UN Security Council resolution in June imposing new sanctions on Iran's nuclear program after the two countries negotiated a deal to swap enriched uranium for fuel to power a reactor for medical isotopes. Brazil's foreign ministry defended the move to recognise Palestinian sovereignty, saying it still believed a negotiated settlement between Israel and the Palestinian leadership was ""essential"". More than 100 states, mostly from Asia, Africa and the Middle East, have recognised Palestinian statehood, and Brazil becomes the last of the BRIC group of emerging powers - Brazil, Russia, India and China - to do so. But Israel fears that other South American countries could now follow suit and there was speculation that Peru may do so in the next few days. Telegraph, London; Bloomberg"

Speaking to university students in Tehran, Manuchehr Mottaki said that production of narcotics and instability had increased in Afghanistan after the start of the US-led operation there. He also said there were two issues of Iran-US relations that could have ""destructive effects"", but did not specify what these issues are. He added that Iran ""will not compromise over the natural nuclear rights of the Iranian nation"". The following is the text of report in English by Iranian official government news agency IRNA website; subheadings as published: Tehran, 12 January: Foreign Minister Manuchehr Mottaki said here Monday night [11 January] United States' present day problems include convincing world public opinion and correcting illogical and irrational policies. According to IRNA Political Desk reporter, Mottaki who was back in Tehran from his day-long visit of Syria attended a gathering of Imam Sadeq University students at the airport, gave an address for them and replied to their questions. In his address for the political science students, Mottaki referred to the policies pursued by the former and current US presidents, George W. Bush and Barack H. Obama, arguing, ""Prior to the occupation of Afghanistan by the US-led forces that country's production of opium was a few hundred tones annually, but eight years after occupation Afghanistan is producing some 9,000 metric tons of narcotics a year."" He reiterated, ""Eight years ago, on pretext of the 9/11 attacks, which are still wrapped hallow of ambiguities, (the former US president) George (W.) Bush defined three missions for the US forces, namely restoration of security, combat against extremism, and combat against narcotic drugs trafficking."" The head of Iran's foreign diplomacy apparatus reiterated, ""Today, in addition to several fold increase in production of narcotics in Afghanistan, extremism which was the problem in some parts of that country then is observed almost throughout Afghanistan, plus a noticeable part of Pakistan."" Mottaki referred to the increasing dimensions of insecurity in Afghanistan despite the daily increase of the number of the US and NATO military forces there, reiterating, ""Before the occupation of Afghanistan some parts of that country's soil was insecure, but today the prevailing insecurity is all encompassing, including insecurity at Afghanistan's city, Kabul."" Considering the bulk of analyses on the US presence in Afghanistan, he said, ""The United States neither has shortage of weapons there, nor is in need of more military personnel. Even the US military and the US economy are doing well; the major problem there is convincing the public opinion though and correcting the illogical US policies and strategies."" Iran-US relations Pointing out that restoration of relations is not in the agenda of the IRI foreign policy, Mottaki said, ""As we have mentioned in various interviews, two separate issues of Iran-US relations and Iran-US problems are subjects that can have destructive effects and counter-effects."" He also referred to the nuclear issue, reiterating, ""It is clear for the friends and the foes alike that the government's approaches and pursued policies have managed to clarify the point that we will not compromise over the natural nuclear rights of the Iranian nation, and that we would keep on paving that rough path."" Unhealed wounds of Gaza According to IRNA, Mottaki elsewhere in his talks for Imam Sadeq University Faculty of Political Sciences students said, ""The 33-day Lebanon War and the 22-day Gaza War proved that the dead corps of the Zionist regime will not be revived back to life even with the life-giving blow of Messiah (P), and that resistance is the ultimate word at all scenes today."" He reiterated, ""Gaza was the second serious scene of resistance versus comprehensive aggression a year after the Zionist regime's humiliating defeat in the course of the 33-day War in Lebanon."" The IRI foreign minister reiterated, ""The resistant Gaza still has unhealed wounds on its body though."" Mottaki said, ""A part of those wounds were inflicted by the Zionist enemy, but unfortunately there are also wounds inflicted by some regional countries that are apparently not enemies, against that wounded body."" Fratricide war in Yemen The Iranian top diplomat described the war in Yemen as fratricide, emphasizing the need for careful scrutiny over the events behind the scene there. He added, ""We believe a US-British-Zionist plot is hatched for Yemen aimed at creating another Afghanistan out of it."" Embassies, watchtowers of Islamic system According to IRNA, the foreign minister said that the embassies of a country, particularly those of the Islamic system of Iran abroad are the watchtowers of the country, reiterating, ""Just like the officers at the watchtowers at a warfront that dispatch reports about the status of the enemy, the diplomats at the system's foreign diplomacy watchtowers, too, have to monitor the developments at the international scene."" Specifications of Iran's students movement At the end of his remarks Mottaki focused on the specifications of the Iranian university students' movement, arguing that the first characteristic of this valuable movement is that it is anti-colonialism and anti-foreign hegemony. He added, ""Our student movement considers that problem with many systems their dependence on foreign powers, because lack of independence leads to a flood of lots of problems into the country."" Mottaki finally referred to the anti-dictatorship, anti-totalitarian characteristic of the Iranian students' movement that led to overthrowing the despotic regime of the ousted last shah of Iran.

191,BBC Monitoring Europe - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-04-12,"Turkish daily says western orientation under threat from frustration with EU, US",,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"April 12, 2010",,"Text of report in English by Turkish newspaper Today's Zaman website on 12 April [Column by Omer Taspinar: Turkish Gaullism?] One of the major mistakes in analysing Turkish foreign policy is done when analysts speak of a ""secular"" versus ""Islamic"" divide in Ankara's strategic choices. This is an understandable fallacy. After all, Turkey's population is almost fully Muslim and a political party with Islamic roots has won consecutive election victories. Many policymakers, analysts and scholars thus equate the notion of Turkish divergence from the West - or the fear of ""losing Turkey"" - with the idea of an Islamic revival. Moreover, this is exactly how some members within Turkey's Kemalist establishment - the military, the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the foreign service - describe current Justice and Development Party (AK Party) policies vis-a-vis Iran, Syria, the Gulf and Israel. Such an analysis gives a sense of superficial credibility to the fallacy of an ""Islamist"" foreign policy in Turkey. However, while the growing importance of religion in Turkey should not be dismissed, the real threat to Turkey's Western orientation today is not so much Islamization but growing nationalism and frustration with the United States and Europe. If current trends continue, what we will see emerging in Turkey is not an Islamist foreign policy but a much more nationalist, defiant, independent, self-confident and self-centred strategic orientation - in short, a Turkish variant of ""Gaullism."" As in the case of Charles de Gaulle's anti-American and anti-NATO policies in the 1960s, a Gaullist Turkey may in the long run question Ankara's membership within the military structure of NATO or the logic of waiting decades for the elusive EU membership. In search of full independence, full sovereignty, strategic leverage and, most importantly, ""Turkish glory and grandeur,"" a Gaullist Turkey may opt for its own ""force de frappe"" - a nuclear deterrent - and its own ""Realpolitik"" with countries such as China, India and Russia. One should not underestimate the emergence of such a new Turkey that transcends the Islamic-secular divide because both the Turkish military's Kemalism and the AK Party's neo-Ottomanism - the ideal of regional influence - share such a long-term version. Make no mistake. A majority of Turks still want to see their country firmly anchored in the West, but their patience is wearing thin because of what they perceive to be Western prejudice, double standards and a lack of respect towards their country. New obstacles to EU accession, perceived injustice in Cyprus, growing global recognition of the Armenian genocide and Western sympathy for Kurdish national aspirations are all major factors forcing Turks to question the value of their long-standing pro-Western geostrategic commitments. If you scratch the surface of what seems to be a secular versus Islamist divide in Turkish attitudes towards the West, you will quickly see that both the so-called Islamist and secular camps embrace the same narrative vis-a-vis Europe and America: nationalist frustration. Ironically, Turkey's Kemalists, which were once Western oriented, have now turned perhaps even more anti-Western than the current AK Party government. Until a couple of years ago, I used to argue that Western-oriented Kemalist elites had traded places with the once eastward-leaning Islamists on the grounds that it was the AK Party that seemed more interested in maintaining close ties with Europe and the United States. Now, however, I increasingly believe that the AK Party, too, has decided to jump on the bandwagon of nationalist frustration with the West. After all, this is the most powerful societal undercurrent in Turkey, and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan needs to win elections. Should the West pay attention to Turkish Gaullism? The answer is yes. In the past, Americans and Europeans would often ask whether Turkey had any realistic geopolitical alternatives and complacently reassure themselves that it did not. But today such alternatives are starting to look more realistic to many Turks. The rise of Turkish Gaullism need not come fully at the expense of America and Europe. But Turks are already looking for economic and strategic opportunities in Russia, India, China and, of course, the Middle East and Africa. If the strategic relationship between Ankara and Washington continues to erode and prospects for joining the EU continue to recede, Turkey will certainly go its own way. Americans and Europeans who do not take the risk of such a development seriously underestimate the degree of resentment of the West that has been building up in the country. It is high time for Western analysts to stop overplaying the Islamic-secular divide in Turkish foreign policy and pay more attention to what unites both camps: Turkish nationalism. Gaullism may be the real future for Turkey in the 21st century. Source: Zaman website, Istanbul, in English 12 Apr 10"
192,BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-05-03,"Iraqi foreign minister on ministry's achievements, US withdrawal",,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"May 3, 2010",,"Text of report by Saudi-owned leading pan-Arab daily Al-Sharq al-Awsat website on 1 May [Interview with Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, bu Mu'id Fayyad, from London: ""Zebari to Al-Sharq Al-Awsat: Withdrawal of the US Forces Before the Formation of the Government Is Difficult and Might Hinder this Process""] Since the change of the Iraqi regime in 2003 until today, four governments have succeeded each other in administering Iraq ranging between the government of Paul Bremer, US civil Administrator, and interim, and permanent governments. The Kurdish politician Hoshyar Zebari -leading member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] led by Mas'ud Barzani -has been a foreign minister in all these governments. In fact he was the first foreign minister after the end of the regime of former Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, and he still is while the prime ministers and other ministers have been changed. On the basis of this, Zebari has shouldered all the burdens, difficulties, and complications of the new construction of one of the most important ministries of the government, the Foreign Ministry, and he has become the most prominent engineer of the Iraqi foreign policy. Perhaps one of the most complex issues is being the first Iraqi foreign minister from the Kurdish nation, which constitutes the second national group in Iraq, and all these years he has had to sit down and confer with his Arab opposite numbers, who, according to his expression, have forged distinguished links with him. During his private visit to London, Zebari gave Al-Sharq al-Awsat exclusively an expanded and comprehensive interview about his work experience at the Foreign Ministry in which he explains the difficulties facing the Iraqi foreign policy. Today, Zebari is on the verge of leaving his post as the term of the government ends, and he is a member of the upcoming Iraqi Parliament for the Kurdistan Alliance, and of the committee stemming from the alliance for dialogue with the other political blocs about the formation of the new government. The following is the text of the interview: [Fayyad] At the end of the term of the Government, what is your assessment of the Iraqi foreign policy? [Zebari] I am greatly honoured to have served in this post in four consecutive governments. This is a record achieved under the most difficult circumstances through which Iraq has gone. I take pride in my service during this period in which we have tried to serve our country. Our record testifies to the achievements and accomplishments we have made. The state was in ruins when we took over in September 2003 during the period of the Government Council; and the Foreign Ministry consisted of some isolated, besieged, burned, and ruined embassies. Thus, praise be to God, we have been able, through collective efforts and not individual ones, to rebuild and restore the ministry. This has been achieved as a result of us working on the basis of the principle of national reconciliation. We have been the first ministry to apply this principle. When we took over the ministry it included 1,200 employees ranging between diplomats and administrative officials, and supplemented them from among former members of the intelligence and the Ba'thists. We have dismissed more than 550 employees, because the Foreign Ministry under the previous regime was one of the security ministries, and was a closed shop for the Ba'th Party. We have kept the professional diplomats and administrators, and in practice they have proved their high level of efficiency and national sense. This is why we have been accused, while our aim was, and still is, to keep the wheel of work turning. It is true that when we took over the ministry we had the experience of working abroad, and of the foreign relations of the KDP, but the partisan work, or work in the opposition remains different from official work, the ministry, and work in the state. However, we utilized our previous relations for the benefit of our work in the Foreign Ministry. Moreover, we opened the work in the Foreign Ministry for all, and not only for the elite, the sons of the wealthy or upper-class families, and officials. Two years after we started work, we advertised in the media a training course for diplomatic work, and any Iraqi who satisfied the conditions was able to work in the ministry. We have accepted the highest grade graduates of the Iraqi universities. Also the issue in which I personally take pride is our interest in training and qualifying the cadres of diplomatic work. Moreover, the number of the employees of our ministry is the lowest among the Iraqi ministries compared to its services and importance, as there are less than 2,000 diplomats and administrators in the Foreign Ministry, which is a very small number. We have sent most of them, more then 1,200 employees, to training courses in diplomatic and language training abroad, which is something that is admired by our Arab counterparts. We also changed the culture of work in the Ministry, which used to be characterized by domination, militarism, and centralization, and the employee used to stand before the official as if he was his servant or slave; we have removed all these barriers. I am entitled to take pride in this issue. It is well known that Iraq is a big and old country in international politics. It is one of the founders of the United Nations, the Arab League, and the Non-Aligned Movement. Thus, we have decided to make the diplomatic representation extensive, or at least acceptable; now there are more than 83 diplomatic missions around the world, 67 embassies, and 16 consulates. Therefore, I can say that the upcoming Iraqi Government will take over a developed institution. Add to this that we have ratified the Foreign Service law, which is at the level of the international laws in this field. Despite all the suspicions and distortion that accompanied the work of the ministry, such as claiming that it is a Kurdish ministry and similar things, I do not say that our ministry is an ideal one that is devoid of administrative or financial corruption, but I say that compared to other ministries, the Foreign Ministry is one of the cleanest and most impartial ministries from the point of view of the good reports of the auditing departments and the Commission on Public Integrity. [Fayyad] There are accusations levelled at the Iraqi foreign policy because of the bad relations between Iraq and some regional countries? [Zebari] Iraq was isolated, punished, and marginalized in all Arab and international forums. However, with great efforts we have been able to restore it to its important status, and we broke the isolation ring. To be frank and explicit, this has not taken place only as a result of our efforts, but also with the help and support of our allies in the US and UK Administrations, which liberated Iraq from dictatorship. The work of the Foreign Ministry is a reflection of the domestic policy of the country and its stances; if there is no united stance or a united domestic policy coupled with strong will, there will be no success in the foreign policy however relentless the efforts might be, because the foreign policy will reflect what is taking place domestically. [The same applies] if there is reconstruction, the security situation is solid, the economic situation is good, and the national unity is strong. I admit that one of the problems in which we failed is that we have not been able to play any role in the Arab forums. We have not been able to fulfil our commitments to the issues of destiny, such as the Palestinian issue, supporting the Palestinian [National] Authority, or supporting the regional or international issues to which Iraq was contributing. We have inherited a huge legacy of international sanctions, effects of siege, fragile relations, and problems of water and borders with nearly all the neighbouring countries. This is what we have been focusing on, and that is what any government ought to focus on, try to close all these dossiers, and rectify its relations. In the midst of this hysterical and difficult political situation, we have been able to progress with our work, and to reflect a positive image of the situation and work of the government. The Foreign Ministry does not make the policy, but it implements it; our policy exists in the Constitution, and in the government decisions and viewpoint, because the government is the one that determines Iraq's foreign policy. One of the problems which we faced at the level of our foreign operations is the multiplicity of the sources of media statements and stances given by MP's, advisers, and others. In many cases we receive instructions, but we act according to the interest of the country; thus we have adopted some stances that the others understood. [Fayyad] Was your stance at the last Arab summit in Libya one of these policies? [Zebari] At the last summit, and other summits, we acted according to our relations, and as representatives of the Iraqi Government. The other sides relied on what we said and not on the statement of this MP, or that adviser or politician. [Fayyad] How do the Arab officials receive you as a Kurd in your capacity as foreign minister of Iraq? [Zebari] In the beginning it was a surprise and a strange and odd thing. I remember that I attended my first meeting of Arab foreign ministers in the Arab League in September 2003. The Arab foreign ministers, in jest, said: Let us have fun at his (broken) Arabic. After I talked and delivered speeches, they said: We were wrong, because your Arabic is better than ours. This is a real experience. We behave as a national Iraqi official, and not as a Kurd, and we defend Iraq and the interests of Iraq. Now they have got used to us. At the Arab summit in Sirte (Libya) they said: We have become used to you. I said: This is politics, and we have a diplomatic system; today I am here, and tomorrow there is someone else. I have had excellent relations with my Arab counterparts, and achieved good relations with the Arab officials and leaders, and with the Arab League. [Fayyad] How do you explain the delay of some Arab countries in opening their embassies in Baghdad? [Zebari] The fact is this subject has been exaggerated, and politicized by some Iraqi political sides. They say that Iraq is distant from its Arab and Islamic environment; this is political oneupmanship. When an Iraqi politician meets an Arab leader, does this mean that he is close to that leader and we cannot do the same? For instance, I can meet Egyptian President Husni Mubarak or any other Arab official any day. We tolerate the fact that Iraqi politicians meet Arab leaders outside the government framework; have we had a strong government, it would not have allowed to hold such meetings. This is not supposed to occur. I remember once that the leader of the British Conservative Party met Clinton or Bush in Washington, and there was a commotion that raised Cain in London, because it was considered defiance. Unfortunately, our leaders or politicians are complacent about this issue, and hence they lose their value. [Fayyad] How do you explain the bad relations between Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and some Arab countries, such as Syria, Saudi Arabia, and others? [Zebari] The prime minister is not responsible for these stances. Perhaps I have many issues related to work over which I disagree with the prime minister, but over this issue we have to be realistic. If there is a country or a side that wants to harm Iraq, we must not kiss their hands; this is inadmissible. Today, for instance, there are public activities by Muhammad Yunus al-Ahmad -leading member of the Iraqi Ba'th Party -in Damascus. We have asked the Syrians about him, and we told them that he was active against Iraq; they said: We do not know him at all. Now, here he is. What is his programme or aims? Are his programmes and aims related to participating in government, or developing the political process in Iraq? Definitely not, because he (Al-Ahmad) wants to destroy and blow up everything. There are some issues on which we have to draw the line. For instance, with regard to the relations with Saudi Arabia, the Saudi brethren are the ones who opened the doors, and they opened up to receive various Iraqi leaders, and are the ones who became convinced that there ought to be good relations with Iraq, with which they have the longest common borders; the initiative came from them. The Egyptians, after they realized that they were absent and that the non-Arab neighbouring countries were the ones that would fill the vacuum, woke up and came and opened their embassy in Baghdad. [Fayyad] Have Iran and Turkey filled in the vacuum resulting from the Arab absence in Iraq? [Zebari] I have visited Tehran, Ankara, and even Damascus, and I have said to them beware, and do not think that you will fill in the vacuum that will occur due to the withdrawal of the US forces. The Iraqis will not accept anyone other then themselves to fill in the vacuum in their country. We have the legitimate right to do so. Iran, Turkey, and others are waiting for the withdrawal of the US forces, which are in a hurry to leave Iraq in August, to fill in the vacuum; this is a huge disaster. [Fayyad] What do you think of the Kuwaiti claims over the airplane hired by the Iraqi Airways, which they tried to detain in Britain? How will you deal with the problems with Kuwait? [Zebari] Let me tell you something, several times we have discussed the pending relations with the Kuwaiti brethren. At Sirte summit, we sat with the Amir, deputy prime minister, and foreign minister of Kuwait. There are pending problems between Kuwait and Iraq, and they ought to be resolved. The most prominent of these problems is the issue of the borders that have been demarcated according to UN Security Council Resolution 833, the recognition of which the constitutional Iraqi Government is supposed to reiterate. As for the rest of the issues, they are treatable. These borders have been imposed on Iraq following Saddam's invasion of Kuwait. [Fayyad] Does Iraq recognize these borders? [Zebari] Saddam Husayn agreed to them in 1993. What is required of this government or the upcoming government is to reiterate its recognition of these borders. This is the key to the resolution of all the pending problems between Iraq and Kuwait. I say it frankly, neither the issue of the missing, the prisoners, nor the properties are the obstacles; this issue (the borders) still is pending. We have tried, and we have exerted huge efforts to resolve it; however, we have become convinced that it is a political and not a technical issue. The government has said, now we are on the verge of elections and we will leave this dossier to the upcoming government. [Fayyad] You have spoken of the professionalism of the Iraqi ambassadors, but the issue of the ambassadors constitutes a subject for the accusations levelled at the Foreign Ministry, as there are ambassadors who have been appointed at the level of extraordinary ambassador without any diplomatic background. How do you explain this? [Zebari] The ambassador is supposed to be a professional diplomat who has progressed in his diplomatic career until he reaches the grade of ambassador. However, in many countries there are political appointments, i.e. the government or the head of state chooses a former minister, military officer, or a friend as (former US President) Bush or (US President) Obama did. If you look into the background of some US ambassadors you will discover that they are friends of the president. However this happens within certain percentage such as 10 per cent or more, and could be as much as 25 per cent. The highest percentage of such appointments, as far as we know, is in Egypt. Also we have fixed a percentage of such appointment in the Foreign Service Law, which has been ratified by Parliament and government. However, we are in an interim stage, and all the political sides want to be represented in the diplomatic corpse. I would like to explain the mechanism we used. We have accepted 57 ambassadors out of 150 nominated by the various political blocs; and we have said to all the blocs that we would not accept anyone who does not satisfy even the minimum of the conditions set by our ministry. This is what has taken place, and it was my decision. Among those accepted there have been a large percentage of professional diplomats, and also there have been ambassadors nominated by sides not participating in the government, such as the former Al-Iraqiyah List, national and religious minorities, and also women. The process has not taken place on the basis of quotas alone, but we also took into consideration the diversity of the Iraqi society in addition to those who have been nominated by sides in the government. Moreover, the deliberations and the discussions of the names between the ministry and the Parliament continued for two years until the list of names was given back to us; during that period we sent the candidates to training courses, and attached them to work within the departments of the ministry. After that came the difficult stage, even the most complex one, namely the organization and distribution of the ambassadors. This is a more complex process than forming the government. We were obliged to meet the political leaders and explain to them that the standard of the ambassador nominated by them is not suitable to be appointed to this-or-that country, but he has to be appointed to another country, and so on. There have been many opinions saying that we should not send the names to the countries until after the elections, but I insisted on sending them before the elections. I said: I will send them and you will see the confidence of the countries in us. Indeed, we sent the names of the ambassadors to the countries to which they were nominated. This is an achievement that ought to be recorded for the government and for our ministry. Ten days ago, we received 43 approvals out of 52 nominations to Arab and western countries, and to international organizations. [Fayyad] Why is the Foreign Ministry accused of being a Kurdish ministry? [Zebari] This is not true. If you count the number of Kurds among the administrators and diplomats in the Foreign Ministry you will realize that it is very small, and less than the percentage they deserve. The Kurds are Iraqis, and have the right to work in the diplomatic corps. Moreover, I am not promoting the Kurdish interests, but I promote the Iraqi interests, and the Kurds come within this context. [Fayyad] The Iraqi embassy in London has been, and still is without an ambassador. What are the reasons behind this? [Zebari] Indeed this is a problem. However, there is an ambassador who is a candidate for this post, but I cannot divulge his name now. [Fayyad] Will Hoshyar Zebari remain the foreign minister in the upcoming government? [Zebari] I belong to the Kurdistan Alliance, and this issue is up to the alliance and not to me. When I served as a foreign minister, I was nominated by the Kurdistan Alliance. I am one of the people who consider themselves soldiers in the service of the leadership; this means that today we serve in this post, and tomorrow in another one that is chosen for us by the leadership. This is the first factor. Secondly, this depends of whether or not the Kurdistan Alliance will participate in the government. [Fayyad] Is there any doubt that you will participate in the upcoming government? [Zebari] It is possible to forge coalitions that will be able to form the government with no need for the Kurdistan Alliance, and it is possible to include some Kurds from outside the alliance in the upcoming government. [Fayyad] Do you think that such a possibility might take place? [Zebari] Theoretically, it is possible. The Kurdistan Alliance was strong in the previous elections, and it constituted the second parliamentary bloc. Today, it is the fourth list. However, politically and realistically I do not think that such a possibility might materialize, and all the other blocs agree on the importance of our participation in government. If the negotiations to form the government take place, one of the sovereignty ministries will be in our share. In the past, the choice and agreement was the Foreign Ministry because of the accumulation of expertise and other factors; today, as I said, this is not up to me, but to our leadership. [Fayyad] If the decision is up to you, will you stay at the Foreign Ministry? [Zebari] I can serve at this ministry, because we have accumulated developed experiences, and we have established good relations with our Arab and non-Arab counterparts. However, I reiterate that the political decision is not up to me. [Fayyad] As long as we are talking about the formation of the government, what do you think of the existing dispute on the political arena over this issue, I mean the formation of the new government? [Zebari] The disputes are very severe, and the situation has become extremely complicated for a number of reasons. One of those reasons is that the results are close between the two major blocs, the Al-Iraqiyah (led by Iyad Allawi, former prime minister of the Iraqi Government) and the State of Law (led by Nuri al-Maliki, prime minister of the government whose term has ended). In the previous election there was one bloc that won the majority of the seats and formed the government. As for the current situation, the events will lead to prolonged and complicated negotiations; no serious alliances or dialogues will take place until the ratification of the results of the elections. You know that there are the manual recounting, the looking into the issue of the excluded because of the Deba'thification commission, and other issues; the longer the period, the more complications will appear. [Fayyad] Would you have preferred the results to be ratified without the issuing of the decision to have a manual recount? [Zebari] The problem lies in the electoral system. The (Independent High Electoral) Commission has done its utmost to make the elections succeed, but there are frightening shortcomings in its work, and it has not taken into consideration many issues. Moreover, there is the absence of the support and help from the United States and Britain that had a clear role in the previous elections; this role has been absent in these elections, which contributed to the increase in the difficulties despite the presence of the United Nations. What I mean exactly is the absence of a side that helps and contributes to gathering the winning blocs in order to agree and form the government. [Fayyad] Do you think that the US Administration has withdrawn its hand completely from Iraq? [Zebari] Unfortunately I say that the United States now is not bothered about anything other that withdrawing its forces from Iraq. If the new government is not formed by August, and in the light of these difficult security conditions, the withdrawal of the US forces will be too early, and immature. The US Administration has a problem now, if the government is not formed, the security challenges escalate, and the political problems get complicated, the situation will be extremely complicated, and in my opinion this might affect the timetable of the withdrawal of the US forces. [Fayyad] Have you explained this viewpoint of yours to the US side? [Zebari] Yes, we always meet the US ambassador to Baghdad, and there are dialogues with US Vice President Joe Biden, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and also her assistants. However, so far their viewpoint is to leave the Iraqis to solve their problems on their own. Their message to us is: Solve your problems quickly so that we can get out quickly. [Fayyad] Do you think that the current problem, with regard to the issue of manual recounting and the exclusion of some winners from Parliament, will be internationalized in order to find solutions for it? [Zebari] When the situation gets complicated, it is inevitable that an acceptable side intervenes to help in finding solutions; the candidate for such a role is the United Nations. The issue is not one of internationalization as much as it is giving help, especially as there is an international authorization to the United Nations from the UN Security Council with the agreement of the Iraqi Government to intervene in the situation in Iraq. This authorization is under Chapter 7. Therefore, the United Nations can play a clear role and to express its views in order to help in bringing the various sides together. [Fayyad] Are you optimistic about finding solutions and proceeding with the formation of the government? [Zebari] They call me the eternal optimist; however, after these elections the situation has become difficult. [Fayyad] Difficult? [Zebari] Yes, difficult.

193,BBC Monitoring South Asia - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-06-12,"Pakistan TV show discusses sanctions on Iran, raid on ""Freedom Flotilla""",,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"June 12, 2010",,"Karachi Geo News television in Urdu at 1500 GMT on 10 June carries live regularly scheduled ""Capital Talk"" program relayed from channel's Islamabad studio. Prominent Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir is the host of the popular talk show in Pakistan; Words within double slant lines are in English. Reception: Good Duration: 1 hour Guests: 1. Mushahid Hussain Syed, Pakistan Muslim League-Qaid-e-Azam secretary general; 2. Syed Sumsam Ali Bukhari, minister of state for information and Pakistan People's Party leader; 3. Tariq Fatemi, former ambassador to the United States and a prominent analyst; 4. Nadeem Ahmed Khan, chairperson of an NGO released from Israeli captivity, who was on board ""Freedom Flotilla"" Mir begins the program by saying that the United States has had new economic and military sanctions imposed on Iran through UNSC. These sanctions have been imposed at a time when the entire world was condemning Israeli attacks on Turkish fleet ""Freedom Flotilla"" and it was expected that the UNSC will take action against Israel. Mir adds that so far 200 resolutions have been accepted regarding Palestine out of which 88 UNSC resolutions are such in which Israel has been condemned while there are only six resolutions against Iran, but the United Nations or the United States have not imposed any sanctions against Israel. Mir adds that if we check the record so far, only Muslim countries have become victims of UNSC and such state of affairs is creating many questions among the third world and Muslim countries. Mir further adds that a report of UN Commission on Human Rights condemned drone attacks in Pakistan, but the UNSC has not taken notice of these attacks and today Amnesty International has released a report in Islamabad about drone attacks. Today's discussion will be to find out Pakistan's foreign policy and stance on such issues. Mir asks Bukhari for his reaction on sanctions against Iran instead of Israel. Bukhari says this is a depressing situation particularly in view of Israeli atrocities and aggression when the world was expecting an action against Israel the sanctions have been imposed on Iran who never went out of Iran to attack on any country. Mir asks Syed that he has addressed a press conference today in which he asked the government to take the Palestine matter at the international level and announced that he will join the next convoy for Gaza Strip. Mir asks Syed if he is satisfied on Bukhari's deliberations and Pakistan's stand on this issue. Syed says that he is satisfied over Bukhari's deliberations but the government needs to be more proactive. Syed refers to the 1973 Arab-Israel war when Pakistan, despite being a non-Arab country, sent its air force assistance to Syria through which Israeli planes were shot down. Syed adds that in the national intelligence estimate by the United States, 16 intelligence agencies reported in 2007 that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons; this proves their double standard that Iran was imposed with sanctions while nothing against Israel was done, which increases the gap between the West and the Muslim countries. This will also increase hatred against the United States and it is a political defeat of the United States. Mir asks Fatemi if he is satisfied over the Pakistani Government's stand and what the government should do. Fatemi endorses Bukhari's remarks and says that such statements should be given by other government representatives including the Foreign Office with vigor. Moreover, Fatemi adds, though this resolution is sad but not surprising; we are dissatisfied with the Obama Administration's action but Israel is more dissatisfied than us which is creating an irony that Obama's actions against us are inadequate. Mir asks Khan for his reaction over the sanctions on Iran and his captivity in Israel along with his hundreds of colleagues. Khan says that he did not expect a better treatment from Israel, but while in the Israeli prison, US Embassy officials visited them and inquired about Pakistanis in Israeli captivity and he is very thankful on their assurances for the release by that evening. Khan adds that the issue of Palestine has been projected to the world in a different way by ""Freedom Flotilla"" and says soon after aid convoys from all over the world will assemble in Turkey for onward movement toward Gaza. Mir says that all panelists have unanimity on the issue of Palestine and Iran but there are certain other issues on which we have to see if all of them can develop a consensus, for example, the drone attacks in Pakistan. Mir shows a video report by on Javed Noor's which says that the Amnesty International has released its report in Islamabad on human rights violations according to which more than 1300 people died in Federally Administered Tribal Areas [FATA] and Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa. The government is not paying attention to improve human rights while concerns were raised on American Drone attacks. In this report it was suggested to the government and the Taleban to improve human rights situation, which schools and hospitals should not be targeted and international law on war should be followed. The report adds that four million people of FATA are being directly affected by the Taleban and asked access for non-government organizations to FATA to provide relief to the affected people. The report also calls on the United States to explain laws under which drone attacks are being carried out. Mir asks Fatemi that we are together on Palestine issue, but have not been unanimous on atrocities by the Taleban and US drone attacks. Fatemi says that he will have to differ with Bukhari and Syed as Pervez Musharraf had an agreement with Bush for the use of Pakistani air space and ground bases and when President Zardari went to the United States in September for the first time, he had an agreement with the Bush administration for carrying out drone attacks. Mir concludes program saying that the panelists agreed to take Pakistan ahead toward the vision of its founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Mir says: We must remember that the Pakistan Resolution passed on 23 March 1940 in Lahore was not only for a separate country but also for solidarity with the Palestinians; therefore, Palestine is also our own issue. At the same time we must save Pakistan from those challenging its sovereignty. Mir also adds that the panelists have suggested that the Pakistani government can move UNSC against drone attacks in Pakistan. Source: Geo TV, Karachi, in Urdu 1500gmt 10 Jun 10"

195,The International Herald Tribune,2010-09-14,Turkey sets its sights on a whole new Constitution,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,NEWS; Pg. 3,"September 13, 2010",542 words,"The Islamist-rooted government of Turkey called Monday for an entirely new Constitution next year, in addition to the structural changes approved Sunday to the judiciary, which had been the traditional safeguard of a staunchly secular state. A day after its sweeping victory in a referendum, the Islamist-rooted government of Turkey called Monday for an entirely new Constitution next year, in addition to the structural changes approved Sunday to the judiciary, which had been the traditional safeguard of a staunchly secular state. Huseyin Celik, the deputy chairman of the governing Justice and Development Party, said that if his party were re-elected next year, ''we would prepare a new Constitution in consultation with the opposition, civil organizations and, in overall consensus, it will reflect Turkey's experience.'' With more than 77 percent of the 50 million eligible voters participating in the referendum Sunday, unofficial final results show 58 percent voted in favor and around 42 percent against the 26 constitutional changes, the semiofficial Anatolian News Agency reported. The Senior Electoral Board is expected to issue official results in the coming days. The opposition, led by the Republican People's Party, or C.H.P., has strongly criticized the single-handed approach of the Islamist-rooted government in preparing changes to the Constitution. ''Turkey cannot continue its path with decisions that pleases one out of two people,'' Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the C.H.P., said, according to the Anatolian agency. ''Our wish is to form a society free of oppression and we will be expecting a much clearer approach from the government in this direction.'' The government, led by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, called the amendments approved Sunday essential steps for Turkey's democratic evolution. Most of the changes dealt with the status of women and children, labor union laws and the rights of civil servants, including lifting a ban against the filing of lawsuits against leaders of the 1980 military coup. Rights groups moved quickly to file petitions in Ankara, the capital, to prosecute those leaders. Many critics, however, have considered this referendum as the latest round in a power struggle between the Westernized secular elite and the pious Anatolian majority which has been steadily expanding its power in Turkey, a NATO member with troops in noncombat roles in Afghanistan. The Parliament is expected to reconvene soon to prepare the legislative framework for the implementation of the changes, which the European Union will be monitoring closely to ensure the separation of powers. With an ambitious foreign policy, Turkey has raised its position as a leading player in the region. But improving relations with Iran, Syria and groups like Hamas have irked the country's Western allies, some E.U. member states in particular, putting into question Ankara's eagerness to join the Union. But European officials applauded the vote. The E.U. commissioner for enlargement, Stefan Füle, said the changes were ''a step in the right direction as they address a number of long-standing priorities in Turkey's efforts towards fully complying with the accession criteria,'' The Associated Press reported."
196,The International Herald Tribune,2010-10-26,Turkey steps out; Globalist,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,EDIT; Pg. 6,"October 25, 2010",875 words,"Ankara's foreign minister applies Western ideas and the West doesn't like it. Davutogluism is a mouthful. It's not going to make Fox News any time soon. But if I could escort Sarah Palin, Tea Partiers and a few bigoted anti-Muslim Europeans to a single country illustrating how the world has changed, it would be the home of the D-word, Turkey. Ahmet Davutoglu, who birthed a foreign policy doctrine and has been Turkey's foreign minister since May 2009, has irked a lot of Americans. He's seen as the man behind Turkey's ''turning East,'' as Iran's friend, as Israel's foe, as a fickle NATO ally wary of a proposed new missile shield, and as the wily architect of Turkey's new darling status with Arab states. The Obama administration has said it is ''disappointed'' in Turkey's no vote on Iran sanctions last June; Congress is not pleased, holding up an ambassadorial appointment and huffing over arms sales. Nostalgia is running high in Washington for the pliant Turkey of Cold-War days. Davutoglu is having none of it. ''We don't want to be a frontier country like in the Cold War,'' he told me. ''We don't want problems with any neighbor'' - and that, of course, would include Iran. Zero problems with neighbors lay at the core of Davutoglu's influential book ''Strategic Depth,'' published in 2001. Annual trade with Russia has since soared to $40 billion. Syrian-Turkish relations have never been better. Turkey's commercial sway over northern Iraq is overwhelming. It has signed a free trade agreement with Jordan. And now Turkey says it aims - United Nations sanctions notwithstanding - to triple trade with Iran over the next five years. All this makes the anemic West edgy: The policy has produced 7 percent growth this year. There's also something deeper at work: The idea of economic interdependence as a basis for regional peace and stability sounds awfully familiar. Wasn't that the genius of the European Union idea? Which prompts another question: Can it only work for Westerners? I don't think so. And, having shortsightedly kept Turkey out of the European Union, the West is scarcely qualified to complain. As British Prime Minister David Cameron, Turkey's strongest European supporter, said recently, ''It is just wrong to say that Turkey can guard the camp but not be allowed to sit in the tent.'' Wrong indeed, and stupid, but that's where Turkey is, with at least a foot outside the Western tent, and increasingly proud of what it has achieved in a transformed world. Nations have increasing options. They don't depend as much on the United States. Congress can rail about that and it won't change a thing. Turkish foreign policy, Davutoglu said, ''is based on a realistic, rational analysis of the strategic picture.'' Yep. So it gets prickly over U.S. guidance. When I asked Davutoglu about the visit last week of Stuart Levey, a senior Treasury department official, to Ankara to talk about Iran sanctions, he bristled: ''We don't need any advice,'' he told me. ''We are a responsible country of the U.N. system and a member of the U.N. Security Council. We voted no. That is our decision. We have no need to be told by anyone, we will implement the U.N. Security Council resolution. But as for unilateral resolutions - American or European - we will look at our own national interest. Is it wrong to have strong economic relations with neighbors?'' I think Turkey's immediate recognition of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad following his violent electoral putsch of June 2009 was the low point of Davutogluism. But I also think Turkey has Iran policy about right. Isolation comforts the hard-liners. Sanctions won't turn Iran. A Turkish-Brazilian swap deal for Iran's low-enriched uranium, reached last May, was a means ''to open the way for diplomatic negotiations.'' Davutoglu was adamant: ''Of course we were coordinating with the Americans at every stage. Nobody from Washington can say Turkey acted on its own. Our purpose was to ease the tension and to contain the Iranian nuclear program.'' Turkey can be the West's conduit to the Muslim world if Washington can bury its pique. The new Turkey won't abandon NATO or its American alliance: If NATO wants to talk to the Taliban, or the West to Iran, it can help. But when Turkish-Israeli relations implode, rumblings on Capitol Hill get furious. That Turkey's Iran diplomacy coincided with Israel's killing of eight Turkish and one U.S. citizen on a Turkish-led Gaza-bound flotilla was a fluke. Still, it has left bitter feelings. ''Turkey expects solidarity from the United States because its citizens were killed in international waters,'' Davutoglu said. ''This is an issue of national pride.'' He added, referring to Israel, ''Yes, we expect an apology because we think friends can apologize to one another.'' Far from U.S. solidarity, Turkey got U.S. hostility. One congressman wrote to President Obama demanding that he ''condemn Turkey's reaction to the incident.'' That last sentence cries out for an exclamation mark. It reflects the Turkey-equals-Iran-lover-and-Israel-hater surge in Congress. That's the kind of cheap jingoistic nonsense that boxes in Obama's Mideast policy and condemns it to tired failure. It's time for Davutogluism to roll off more American tongues."
197,The International Herald Tribune,2010-11-12,Obama sets conditions for North Korea; U.S. offers to restart talks if Pyongyang shows it's serious on nuclear issue,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,NEWS; Pg. 3,"November 11, 2010",805 words,"President Barack Obama said Thursday that it was up to North Korea to decide to end its economic and political isolation and resume talks on its nuclear disarmament. President Barack Obama said Thursday that North Korea must show a ''seriousness of purpose'' before talks could be restarted on its nuclear disarmament, saying it was up to the North to decide to end its economic and political isolation. Speaking after a meeting with President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea on the sidelines of a summit meeting of the Group of 20 economies in Seoul, Mr. Obama said the North must show it is serious about ending its nuclear weapons program before the so-called six-party talks involving the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States can resume. However, he also offered North Korea's reclusive regime a carrot in addition to the stick of continued isolation. He said the United States, South Korea and other nations were ready to offer hefty economic aid if North Korea gave up its weapons once and for all. ''They have a choice available to them,'' Mr. Obama said, referring to the North Koreans. ''At the point where it appears that they are in fact prepared to move forward on the kind of path that all of us want to see, then we're going to be there ready to negotiate with them.'' While Washington has made such offers before, political analysts in Seoul said the opening comes amid signs of a slight but significant softening in the stance of the United States and particularly South Korea toward the North. ''There has been a definite mood shift in Northeast Asia toward resuming the six-party talks,'' said Kim Hyun-wook, a professor at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security, a government-run research institute in Seoul. The shift began earlier this week, when the South Korean president backed away from his insistence that the talks could not restart until the North apologized for the sinking of a South Korean warship, the Cheonan, earlier this year. Mr. Lee said the North must only take responsibility for the sinking, which Seoul has attributed to a North Korean torpedo. North Korea has denied involvement. ''North Korea should and must show sincerity towards the Republic of Korea and to assume responsibility for what they did to the Cheonan,'' Mr. Lee said Thursday, using the official name for South Korea. Analysts said the more conciliatory tone marks a shift for Mr. Lee, who took office two years on a conservative platform of closer ties with the United States and a more hawkish stance toward the North. The need to rein in the North's weapons programs was underscored earlier this week when the U.N. Security Council received a report saying that North Korea had exported banned nuclear and missile technology to Iran, Syria and Myanmar. Analysts said there had also been recent signals by other participants in the six-party talks, China and Russia, that they desired a reduction of tensions in the region. On Wednesday, President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia, who was in Seoul for the Group of 20 meeting on the stricken global economy, urged South Korea to resume the six-party talks. Last year, North Korea pulled out of the talks to protest the international condemnation that followed a test of one of its long-range rockets. North Korea has also signaled its willingness to return to the talks. It blames the current impasse on the United States and South Korea, which were among its foes during the 1950-53 Korean War, whom it condemns for holding military exercises along its border. The United States and South Korea have held drills in waters near North Korea as a response to the sinking last March of the 1,200-ton Cheonan, which killed 46 South Korean sailors. Earlier Thursday, Mr. Obama said in a Veterans Day speech at a U.S. Army base in Seoul that the United States remained committed to defending South Korea, and warned North Korea that it faces continued isolation unless it fulfills its commitments to give up nuclear weapons. In a strongly worded statement made before thousands of soldiers and marines gathered on a chilly morning, Mr. Obama called North Korea a starving nation whose economic failures were visible even from space, where at night ''the brilliant lights of Seoul'' can be seen giving way ''to the utter darkness of the North.'' During the speech, Mr. Obama also honored the 37,000 Americans and far larger number of South Koreans who died fighting the North during the Korean War. He also led the audience in a standing ovation for 62 veterans of that war who attended the speech at the Yongsan base, in the center of this city of gleaming skyscrapers and modern highways. ''Gentlemen, we are honored by your presence,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We are grateful for your service. And the world is better off because of what you did here.''"
198,The New York Times,2010-11-30,"Stephen Solarz, Globe-Trotting Congressman, Dies at 70",Late Edition - Final,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,Section B; Column 0; Obituary; Pg. 10,"December 4, 2010",1294 words,"Stephen J. Solarz, a nine-term Democratic congressman whose concerns went beyond traffic lights and beach erosion in his Brooklyn district to nuclear weapons, the Middle East and his revelation that Imelda Marcos owned 3,000 pairs of shoes, died on Monday in Washington. He was 70 and lived in McLean, Va. His death, at a Washington hospital, was caused by esophageal cancer, his wife, Nina, said. When he was elected to the House in 1974, Mr. Solarz finagled a seat on the Foreign Affairs Committee with the idea that he could appeal to his largely Jewish district by attending to the needs of Israel. He immediately threw himself into foreign policy issues, visiting leaders of Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Syria in his first month on the job. He soon became a leading voice in the House on foreign affairs. Mr. Solarz was defeated in a Democratic primary in 1992 after being caught up in a scandal involving the bank operated for House members and after his district had been redrawn to facilitate the election of a Hispanic candidate. But his arrival in 1975 was a moment of triumph, both for himself and for his party. Mr. Solarz was part of a huge class of 75 freshman Democrats who forced changes in the seniority system, giving newer representatives much more influence. The public's interest in global affairs had been heightened by the Vietnam War, and the abuses of presidential power in the Watergate affair had given new steam to Congress. ''I was elected to Congress at precisely the moment in American history when Congress decided it would no longer abdicate its constitutional authority for foreign policy to an executive branch that had lost its claim to presidential infallibility,'' Mr. Solarz wrote in his preface to ''Journeys to War and Peace: A Congressional Memoir,'' to be published in 2011. Mr. Solarz would go on to be the first congressman to visit North Korea in 30 years; have a nine-hour conversation with Fidel Castro; introduce a nuclear freeze resolution; help alter Reagan administration policies in Central America and Lebanon; and battle many in his own party when he supported the Persian Gulf war in 1991. Mr. Solarz visited more than 100 countries, more than earning his nickname, the Marco Polo of Congress. He once got a standing ovation on the floor of the Indian Parliament. Mr. Solarz was a torrent of activity during his first six months in Congress. According to his office, he made 12 speeches on the House floor, co-sponsored 370 bills, held 11 news conferences, made 24 trips to his district and attended 99 events there, visited 23 subway stations, sent constituents 513,720 pieces of mail and took an 18-day tour of the Middle East. And he became adept at winning the support of House colleagues. ''You don't just win on the merits,'' Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts said after Mr. Solarz's death. ''He understood legislating.'' Mr. Solarz's early battles included an unsuccessful effort to stop the Carter administration's sale of F-15 jets to Saudi Arabia in 1978. The next year, Mr. Solarz was named chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee's African subcommittee and worked with President Jimmy Carter to thwart the lifting of sanctions against Rhodesia for its racist policies. In 1981, he gave up his post on the African subcommittee to take over the subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs. There he developed a peace plan that helped end the genocide in Cambodia. He returned from his 1980 visit to North Korea with the news that the country's dictator, Kim Il-sung, was interested in improving relations with the United States. In his 1986 hearings on the Philippines, Mr. Solarz provided irrefutable evidence that President Ferdinand Marcos was misusing foreign aid, leading to the uncovering of the vast United States real estate empire he shared with his wife, Imelda -- not to mention Mr. Solarz's blockbuster disclosure about her shoes. In an interview, Robert Dallek, the presidential historian, praised Mr. Solarz's commitment to building democracy in places like the Philippines, South Korea, Lebanon and Taiwan. ''He struck idealistic notes with a lot of his colleagues,'' Mr. Dallek said. But he was also pragmatic, said Paul D. Wolfowitz, the former deputy defense secretary and World Bank president, who worked with Mr. Solarz on Asian issues during the Reagan administration. Mr. Solarz, he said, showed that allying with forces fighting repression could be good policy. ''Solarz understood that idealism and realism actually go together,'' he said. Stephen Joshua Solarz was born on Sept. 12, 1940, in Manhattan. His parents, Sanford Solarz and the former Ruth Fertig, divorced soon after his birth, and his mother vanished from his life. He was raised first by his father and a stepmother, then by a widowed aunt in Brooklyn after his father divorced again. His political career began when he was elected president of his sixth-grade class; he was later elected president of the student government at Midwood High School in Brooklyn. After graduating from Brandeis University, where he edited the school newspaper, he entered Columbia Law School. But he quickly became bored by the law and switched his studies, earning a master's degree in public law and government from Columbia. While at Columbia he joined the ranks of reform Democrats in Brooklyn, and at 25 he helped run the primary campaign of Melvin Dubin, an antiwar candidate for Congress. Mr. Dubin lost, but while working for the campaign Mr. Solarz met Nina Koldin, whom he later married. She survives him, as do his mother, Ruth Robin; his brothers, Avrom and Seth Robin; his stepson, Randy Glantz; his stepdaughter, Lisa Prickett; and four grandchildren. Mrs. Solarz had persuaded her husband to run for the State Assembly in 1968 and, using her inheritance, had bankrolled his early campaigns, including his first race for Congress in 1974. She pleaded guilty in 1995 to two criminal charges of writing bad checks against their account at the House bank. Mr. Solarz, despite 743 overdrafts, was not charged. Before running for Congress, Mr. Solarz served three terms in the Assembly. He lost a race for Brooklyn borough president in 1973 but generally won elections by high margins. He lost his district, however, when the state's Congressional delegation shrunk to 31 from 34 because of population loss. Choosing to run in a district that had been reconfigured to include parts of Queens, Manhattan and Brooklyn to help a Hispanic candidate win, he faced five Hispanic opponents in the Democratic primary and lost to Nydia M. Velazquez, who went on to win the general election and remains the district's representative. After his political career Mr. Solarz worked as a consultant and volunteer for nonprofit international organizations. He was a leader of the International Crisis Group, which works with governments and global organizations to quell deadly conflicts. As a congressman Mr. Solarz was always mindful of local issues, calling himself ''Representative Pothole.'' In 1990, he introduced a bill denying a sports team that leaves a city the right to sue for trademark infringement. The bill grew out of a suit filed by the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Brooklyn Dodgers Sports Bar and Restaurant in Brooklyn. Mr. Solarz wanted to get in one last lick at the team that had fled to the West Coast and broken his borough's heart."
199,The Washington Post,2010-10-28,Four House GOP figures who could be crucial to foreign policy Four House GOP figures who could be crucial to foreign policy,Met 2 Edition,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,A-SECTION; Pg. A17,"October 28, 2010",721 words,"Congress may not be in charge of making foreign policy, but it sure can influence its implementation. Since taking office in January 2009, members of Congress - drawn primarily but not exclusively from the ranks of the GOP - have slowed the Obama administration's efforts to advance its strategy for dealing with Russia, Syria, Israel, Cuba and a host of other countries. And the midterm elections won't be making things any easier for President Obama. Republican lawmakers stand to play a huge role in debates next year about the promised July 2011 drawdown of troops in Afghanistan, whether to maintain or increase U.S. foreign assistance packages, and how strongly to press countries such as Russia and China to implement new sanctions against Iran. If current poll results hold, Republicans will make significant gains in the Senate and probably will take the House, elevating a set of lawmakers to new heights of power and complicating Obama's efforts to execute his foreign policy agenda. Here's a list of four GOP figures in the House who could be crucial actors on the foreign policy stage when the dust settles after Tuesday's elections. The Virginia congressman, who is the House minority whip, could become majority leader in a GOP-controlled House if Minority Leader John A. Boehner (Ohio) is elected speaker. Cantor, who is particularly active in foreign-policy issues involving Iran and Israel, could see his role expand significantly if he is given the power to set the House floor agenda. That could spell trouble for the administration's foreign operations budget, which funds the State Department and sets levels for U.S. non-military assistance around the world. Republicans are threatening to withhold aid to countries they think aren't wholly supportive of the United States, and Cantor told the Jewish Telegraph Agency recently that the president's proposed budget might have to be rejected outright if Republicans take power - after separating out U.S. aid for Israel. If Republicans take the House, Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.) is poised to take over the House Foreign Affairs Committee and could drastically alter the administration's agenda. For example, she is likely to scuttle the drive to ease sanctions and travel restrictions on Cuba, which Chairman Howard L. Berman (D-Calif.) supports. Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Havana, is an active member of the Cuban American lobby. Her ascendancy could also spell doom for Berman's bill on foreign-aid reform. She argues often for more vetting of foreign aid in the hope of finding cuts, and she has also introduced legislation to cut U.S. funding for the United Nations and the Palestinian Authority. A vocal critic of what she considers the Obama team's cool approach to Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Ros-Lehtinen could also use the committee as a sounding board for those who want changes in the administration's approach to Middle East peace. ""She's no Dick Lugar,"" said one House aide, referring to her temperate Senate counterpart. ""You'll probably see a lot of contentious hearings."" Although not certain, it's likely that Granger (Tex.) would take over the chairmanship of the House Appropriations subcommittee for State Department and foreign operations if the GOP wins the House. That would give her a large role in writing significant sections of the State Department's funding bill. Although she supported the legislation put forth this year by Chairman Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.), she criticized the increases for the foreign-ops budget. She's a strong supporter of a balanced budget amendment, which doesn't bode well for foreign-aid funding. Granger also serves on the defense subcommittee, placing her at the intersection of the debate over how to balance the national security budget and shift resources from defense to diplomacy and development. Here she seems to favor the Pentagon, saying in June, ""I want to be sure that we aren't increasing foreign aid at the expense of our troops."" Royce (Calif.) is symbolic of GOP House members who are active in foreign policy. He could become chairman again of the House Foreign Affairs Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade subcommittee, where his staff could hold hearings on the Middle East, Africa, Afghanistan and any other region sensitive to the administration's national security goals."
200,The Washington Post,2010-11-07,Abducted in Egypt,Regional Edition,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"November 7, 2010",457 words,"LAST APRIL, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak disregarded appeals from the Obama administration and violated his own public promises by renewing the ""emergency law"" that for decades has allowed security forces to prevent public demonstrations, break up political meetings, close media outlets and arrest opposition activists without charge. When the administration protested, Egyptian officials assured it that the law henceforth would be applied only in terrorism and drug cases. The White House cited that pledge in a recent summary of its human rights accomplishments. Now, with a parliamentary election approaching, the regime's political repression has grown more rather than less severe. Hundreds of political activists from the banned Muslim Brotherhood party have been arrested; critical television talk shows and newspaper columns have been canceled; student leaders have been rounded up. In a number of recent cases, peaceful political activists, including those supporting secular democratic movements, have been ""disappeared"": abducted and held for days by the secret police and sometimes beaten or tortured, before being released on roads outside Cairo. As he pledged, Mr. Mubarak has done all this without use of the emergency law. Instead the regime has begun acting entirely outside the rule of law. The young activists who have been beaten or kidnapped have no recourse; there is no case to contest, and they are unable even to identify those who assault them. This slide by Egypt toward the police-state methods usually associated with Syria or Sudan is a problem for the United States as well as for Egyptians. Mr. Mubarak is 82 and ailing; by rejecting political liberalization and choosing deeper repression, he is paving the way for even worse developments once he dies and the struggle to succeed him begins. Mr. Mubarak's successors will need to acquire political legitimacy; if they cannnot do so through democracy they probably will resort to nationalism and anti-Americanism. Fortunately there are signs that the White House is at last waking up to its Egypt problem. This week a number of senior officials met with an ad hoc group of foreign policy experts who have been trying to call attention to the need for a change in U.S. policy. Some good ideas were discussed, such as a strong presidential statement about the conduct of the elections or the dispatch of a special envoy to Cairo. A new U.S. ambassador committed to political change, rather than apologizing for the regime, would help. What's most important is to make clear to Mr. Mubarak that the administration expects some immediate, even if incremental, changes. An end to the beating and abduction of peaceful activists would be a good place to start."
201,Asharq Alawsat (English),2010-10-13,Asharq Al-Awsat Talks to the Quilliam Foundation's Ed Husain,,425,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"October 12, 2011",,"Ed Husain is the co-founder of the Quilliam Foundation, a UK-based think tank focusing on counter-extremism, and author of 'The Islamist'. He was born and raised in London, and has also spent considerable time living and traveling in the Middle East. He was formerly a member of the UK branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a pan-Islamic organization seeking to unify all Muslim states under a single caliphate. Husain now strongly criticizes such organizations, and is an advocate of integration between Muslims and the Western world, and counter extremism. Following the publication of his book in 2007, Husain has made numerous contributions to media and political debates regarding such subjects. Asharq al-Awsat met with Ed Husain in London, to discuss his past experiences as a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir, and his retrospective opinions of his time in the organization. The interview also touched upon the work of the Quilliam Foundation, and Ed Husain's forthcoming plans to work as a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States. The following is the transcript from the interview. [Asharq Al-Awsat] How long were you a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir? [Hussein] Almost three years. [Asharq Al-Awsat] When you joined them, did you read and memorize all the official statements and writings, issued by the organization? [Hussein] I cannot say for sure that I memorized everything they wrote by heart. Hizb ut-Tahrir has lots of publications that members can only see after reaching certain stages. Perhaps the ""System of Islam"" is the most famous one. [Asharq Al-Awsat] Who was your mentor at Hizb ut-Tahrir? [Hussein] Farid Qasim was my first mentor at the party. He is an Iraqi architect. He subsequently left the party and became more radical, and joined another organization. There are two branches of Hizb ut-Tahrir in Britain. The main branch has a Khomeini-like ideology, which we all know. As for the second, it broke away from the main party, and this was the branch that Qasim joined. Prior to joining Hizb ut-Tahrir, I was educated on the works of Abul Ala Mawdudi , Muslim Brotherhood thinker Sayyid Qutb, and Taqiy-al-Din al-Nabahani. [Asharq Al-Awsat] What was your position within the organization? Were you a member of its ideological arm, or its recruitment drive? [Hussein] My work primarily dealt with recruitment and development strategies. During that period, specifically between 1995 and 1998, Hizb ut-Tahrir`s efforts were restricted to only some universities, particularly the faculties of medicine. The first task carried out by my generation was to bring Hizb ut-Tahrir to Tower Hamlets, a British area known for its large Muslim population. I was the head of the Islamic Society, at a college in Tower Hamlets, and I was in charge of introducing Hizb ut-Tahrir to the East London Mosque, the largest mosque in Britain. I was also involved in developing the strategy for recruiting ordinary party members. [Asharq Al-Awsat] How many members of Hizb ut-Tahrir are based in the United Kingdom? [Hussein] It is difficult to estimate the number, but I do not think that there are more than 300 or 400 members. But this is just the main circle of members, whereas the party has a large number of supporters, whose number may reach 3,000 or perhaps 4,000. [Asharq Al-Awsat] When you were a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir, did you believe in the return of the caliphate, and that it could actually be achieved? [Hussein] We used to believe that it would happen very soon. I was 17 or 18 then, and my parents were immigrants from India, and we did not know any Arabs. Umar Bakri was the first Arab person we met. And because the Koran is in Arabic, and the Prophet Muhammad was himself an Arab, it was as if we came under a strong spell. Bakri told us that there are members of Hizb ut-Tahrir in every household in Lebanon, and that the party enjoys strong support in Saudi Arabia. He showed us evidence of this, using examples such as Muhammad al-Masadi, who is a high ranking university professor in Saudi Arabia. Bakri assured us that the caliphate would return, because the party was close to assuming power in Jordan, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia. Therefore, who I was to judge Bakri, and tell him that he was wrong? In 1994 we held a large conference on the subject of the caliphate at Wembley Conference Center, in which al-Masadi and others from all over the world took part. A genuine belief was generated inside us, that the caliphate was going to return soon. We believed that the caliphate would return by next Eid or next Ramadan. However, this has never happened. [Asharq Al-Awsat] Do you still believe in this? [Hussein] Now I believe that this will never happen. But at that time, this was what we believed. [Asharq Al-Awsat] When did you leave Hizb ut-Tahrir? [Hussein] Approximately in August, 1997. [Asharq Al-Awsat] Why did you leave Hizb ut-Tahrir? Was it because of the murder incident [referring to the death of a student outside Newham College, East London, in 1996, allegedly as the result of a dispute between Muslim and non-Muslim students] or your wife's influence? [Hussein] Both. I was involved in a love story, and my wife is a British Muslim with Indian roots. She gave me a different purpose in my life. However, one of the deeper reasons was that my parents were always against me joining Hizb ut-Tahrir, because they belong to the mainstream of Hanafi Islam, like the Muslims in Egypt and Syria. My father used to wake up for dawn prayers, eager to recite Koran until sunrise. This is something that I became accustomed to from a young age. However, when I was a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir, I remember that we often missed the dawn and evening prayers, because we were busy distributing leaflets. This highlights the contradiction between my situation, when I was a member of the party, and the real Islam. This is the difference between Hizb ut-Tahrir and honest, heartfelt Islam. Hizb ut-Tahrir was a mere political organization, concerned with political activism, anger, and confrontation, but it was hollow inside. [Asharq Al-Awsat] Were there Arab members within Hizb ut-Tahrir? [Hussein] Yes, many Arabs. This was one of the main points that attracted people like myself to join Hizb ut-Tahrir, to be in the presence of many Arabs whom we considered ""the real Muslims"". We used to consider ourselves as second class Muslims on the sidelines, particularly since we did not speak Arabic. [Asharq Al-Awsat] Were they Arab students? [Hussein] Yes. The idea behind recruiting them was for the purpose of carrying out military coups. Efforts were made to recruit them, and then send them back to their home countries to carry out coups d'etat. At the same time, Hizb ut-Tahrir inspired, or reinforced, my desire to learn the Arabic language, which was something that my father had instilled in me. I was encouraged to spend some time in the Middle East, which was a positive experience, because you realize that the Arabs are like any other nation, and there is nothing prohibitive that distinguishes them. [Asharq Al-Awsat] So, Hizb ut-Tahrir's agenda was to send its members back home to recruit more Arabs. Is that true? [Hussein] Yes, we used to look up to the Arabs, considering them the ""people of victory"". We thought that they would be the ones that would give us support in military and political fields. However, this situation has changed since 1998, when Pakistan joined the nuclear club, and thus became the primary concern. But until that moment, the Arabs were of utmost importance. [Asharq Al-Awsat] During your time with Hizb ut-Tahrir, did the organization hold lectures and seminars to review their strategies, as is the case now? [Hussein] Yes. Generally speaking, there are two levels in Hizb ut-Tahrir. The first consists of the scholars, the individuals who are devoted to learning, and the second level is the active members. I was a scholar, therefore, I had to attend a secret meeting once a week at Tower Hamlets, and Farid Qasim assumed the post of supervisor. [Asharq Al-Awsat] Where is Farid Qasim now? [Hussein] Here in London. He is from an Iraqi father and a British mother. If you want to mention a name that will draw the attention of Hizb ut-Tahrir members, it is the name of Dr Nasim Ghani. He is the person who recruited me to join Hizb ut-Tahrir. Ghani is originally from Bangladesh, but at present he is the leader of the party in the United Kingdom, but he tends to keep away from the spotlight, and shrouds himself in an aura of secrecy. [Asharq Al-Awsat] How much time did it take you to write your book [The Islamist, 2007]? [Hussein] Almost a year. [Asharq Al-Awsat] Can you give us a brief summary of the book? [Hussein] The book came after the 7 July attacks, in light of the confusion that struck the moderate political stratum here in Britain, in differentiating between Islam and terrorism. Most of the arguments raised focused on this question: Does Islam bear the blame for what happened? For their part, the Islamic organizations here emphasized that they have nothing to do with terrorism, extremism, and these ideologies. Therefore, I tried to discuss and explain that my generation had been attracted to radical ideology here in Britain before the 7 July bombings, and even before the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States. I wanted to point out that foreign policy has a role [in radicalizing Islamic youth], and it can even be considered the trigger that set off the attacks. But let us not deny the responsibility of Hizb ut-Tahrir and other organizations. This was the background of the book. The book has been a success; it was the best seller here and received wide media coverage. Yet, the most important achievement of the book was that it opened many doors for me to meet with politicians, the media, and society leaders, in addition to helping me to establish the Quilliam Foundation, based on the contacts I had gained. [Asharq Al-Awsat] Tell us about the establishment of the Quilliam Foundation? [Hussein] The Quilliam Foundation was founded in 2007, by myself and Majid Nawaz, who was a colleague of mine in the party, before he broke away. We named the foundation after a British lawyer, who was also a Muslim. We tried to prove that Islam is not something strange, new, or alien in Britain. The message we tried to convey was that Islam, and its place within British identity, was not always contradictory. Rather, Islam is a religion like Judaism and Christianity, and like any other religion, it should be given the chance to freely prosper here. Quilliam was a white Christian who converted to Islam, and by choosing his name, we tried to return Islam to the pre 1960's of the last century, and before the British Empire, to the British Islamic history. The Quilliam Foundation is considered the first research establishment designed to combat extremism. It fights Islamists, and not Islam, because it believes that the Islamist considers Islam to be a political ideology. There are varying levels of Islamists, and they differ in how to implement their ideologies. Many of them live a modern social life, but have extremist political ideas. They are usually despised by Muslim clergymen and ordinary Muslims, and tend to advocate a hatred of the West. The Quilliam Foundation has several units and cells to confront extremism, to enlighten people about it and its dangers, and to provide assistance to those who want to eradicate it. What distinguishes us from other organizations is that all our training courses are carried out in participation with former members of fundamentalist organizations, because it is difficult, without a direct experience of extremism, to have an awareness of the internal workings of such organizations, and the mechanisms used to recruit extremists, and ways of convincing them. [Asharq Al-Awsat] Does The Quilliam Foundation receive any government assistance? [Hussein] Yes, it receives direct financial assistance from the government, and in return we offer advice to the government. [Asharq Al-Awsat] Can you talk to us a little bit about fundamentalist websites, and whether these people [the website administrators] can be prosecuted for their adverse influence on Muslims in the country? [Hussein] The current British law, known as the 'law against glorifying terrorism', permits the prosecution of individuals who run or contribute to these websites, because they incite violence and glorify terrorism. However, we do not know why the government has not prosecuted anyone yet. For us, our concern is not about these individuals, but about the thousands of young Muslim men who log on to these websites, and follow the discussions that take place there, because what is put in front of them is a one-sided argument. Therefore, one of the things that we are trying to achieve is to expose the secret world of around 100 jihadist websites, which have thousands of members. For example, Al-Fallujah website has about 60,000 members. I do not mean here that all such sites are jihadist in nature, but I mean that there are many interactions that go by unnoticed. Intelligence officials in various countries are working to shut down these websites, and we ask for the opportunity to discuss this matter with them, and to engage with them in the challenge. [Asharq Al-Awsat] It has been noted recently that many white individuals have converted to Islam through Hizb ut-Tahrir. Have you noticed that? [Hussein] Regrettably yes. Islam has been propagated as a political ideology, similar to that of Communism. In other words, they share the idea that Capitalism is wrong because it is morally bankrupt, with the capitalist regime currently suffering from high crime rates and numerous incidences of rape and indecency. So what is the alternative? It is the Islamic system. Unfortunately, it has become is easy to recruit young men aged 18 or 19, inside the universities, and attract them to the style of Islam embraced by Hizb ut-Tahrir, which is Islam of a political nature, based on confrontation. [Asharq Al-Awsat] What is, in your opinion, the best or the most common way for recruiting people? [Hussein] Firstly: To draw a link between the recruitment drive and current international affairs, which incite emotions. In my case, Hizb ut-Tahrir based their recruitment around what was happening in Bosnia. If white Muslims, with blonde hair and blue eyes, were being killed, then what chance did I have, a young man with dark skin and black eyes, especially as those who were killed in Bosnia had been there for 400 years? The Hizb ut-Tahrir officials held banners in front of us saying ""Britain Today, Bosnia Tomorrow."" Hence, they sowed fear into our hearts, when we were only 18 or 19. Since then, they have recruited individuals by manipulating the issues of Iraq, the Arab-Israeli conflict, and all the great unresolved international conflicts which incite emotions. Hizb ut-Tahrir presented a solution of its own, regarding these issues, and thus attracted us to the idea of the caliphate and jihad. [Asharq Al-Awsat] Has Hizb ut-Tahrir offered anything specific, in order to encourage the youth to join it? [Hussein] I think that they actually offer a network of support and ideas. Any member of Hizb ut-Tahrir can go to any city in the country and find friends, support, and a place to stay there. [Asharq Al-Awsat] Is the US Council on Foreign Relations, where you are going to move to, considered a government entity? [Hussein] It is not a government entity, it works independently, but it plays a very important role in offering advice to the government and criticizing its policies, and is considered one of the oldest research institutes in the United States, since its establishment in 1921. [Asharq Al-Awsat] Can you tell us more about your work at the US Council on Foreign Relations? [Hussein] I will start my work in this field in December. The Council on Foreign Relations is based in Washington, the U.S. capital, and in New York. I am a senior fellow there, and I will focus on confronting terrorism, the dissemination of extremist ideology, media coverage of Islam, and issues related to Muslims in the United States. This is a good chance to enlighten the US public, regarding the viewpoints of ordinary Muslims, and to inform them that Islam, as a faith, does not threaten the United States or U.S. values. Currently, with proposals to burn copies of the Koran, and the [controversy surrounding the] so-called 'Ground Zero Mosque', it is clear that there is fear amongst the American public. The Council on Foreign Relations does not belong to the right or left in American society, but it stands as an impartial advisor to the government, and guides civil society. It can publish comments in the US media, without being viewed as an entity affiliated with the neo-conservative or liberal trends, but as a fully independent entity. [Asharq Al-Awsat] Were there any fellow Muslims at the Council on Foreign Relations, before you? [Hussein] Time Magazine's Fareed Zakaria was on the Council's board. [Asharq Al-Awsat] Have you been to any Arab countries? [Hussein] I lived in Syria for two years and learned Arabic there. I was teaching English and worked at the British Council. I spent the period between 2003 and 2005 in Damascus. I then did the same in Jeddah from late 2005 until the end of 2006. I also spent some time near Mecca and Medina. [Asharq Al-Awsat] What was your university degree? [Hussein] I obtained a Masters degree from the School of Oriental and African Studies - the Middle East Division, in 2007. I have a keen interest in the Middle East, and prior to this I obtained an undergraduate degree in history, from the University of London."
202,Weekend Australian,2010-07-03,Turkey acts to ease fears over Islamic ties,1 - All-round Country Edition,AUS,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,WORLD; Pg. 18,"July 2, 2010",864 words,"TURKEY has hit back at accusations it is turning its back on the West in favour of closer ties with the Islamic world, insisting that membership of the EU is its key foreign policy goal. ``There is no reason to have any doubts about Turkey,'' President Abdullah Gul declared in a forceful interview designed to allay alarm in Europe and the US about its increasingly close relations with radical Middle East regimes. Turkey was not ``lost'', he said, denouncing such claims as ``unacceptable'' and stressing that Turkey was also forging ties far beyond the Arab world. ``I consider it very wrong to interpret Turkey's interests with other geographic regions as it breaking from the West, turning its back on the West or seeking alternatives to the West. Turkey is part of Europe,'' he said. Mr Gul argued that the US and Europe should welcome its growing engagement in the Middle East because it was promoting Western values in a region largely governed by authoritarian regimes. Rebuking some Western politicians for their outdated views of Turkey, he insisted the country had undergone a ``silent revolution''. It was now a big economic power that had embraced democracy, human rights and the free market. It had become a ``source of inspiration'' in the region. ``If this is not acknowledged, it's a pity,'' Mr Gul lamented. Turkey is a strategically vital country of 72 million people that straddles the border of Europe and Asia, has NATO's second-largest army and is a supply hub for US war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. It has also caused consternation in Western capitals in recent months. Not only has it welcomed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran and congratulated him on his stolen election victory, it also voted against UN sanctions to try to halt the Iranian nuclear program. The nation has lent support to Hamas, which is on the US and EU lists of terrorist organisations. ``We are respecting the choice of the Palestinian people in Gaza,'' Mr Gul said. Turkey was preparing to host President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, who is wanted for crimes against humanity, at an Islamic conference until the EU objected. It has assiduously courted Syria, with whom it nearly went to war in 1998. At the same time, Turkey has condemned Israel, formerly its closest regional ally and supplier of much of its military hardware, over its invasion of Gaza and the recent killing by Israeli commandos of nine Turkish civilians on a Gaza-bound flotilla. Apart from one secret ministerial meeting this week, relations are frozen, with Turkey demanding an apology and compensation. Mr Gul insisted Turkey had always been Israel's friend but asked: ``If an army of a state kills your people in international waters, how would you react?'' From the US, particularly, there have been clear signs of displeasure and mutterings about how the ruling AK Party is returning to its Islamic roots. US President Barack Obama had a frosty meeting with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan at last weekend's G20 summit. ``We think Turkey remains committed to NATO, Europe and the US, but that needs to be demonstrated,'' said Philip Gordon, the administration's top European diplomat. Mr Gul admitted there was ``a gap between perception and reality and it needs some clarification''. Speaking in his summer residence overlooking the Bosphorus, he described a country that has Europe's fastest -- and almost only -- expanding economy, with 11 per cent growth in the first quarter of this year alone and the continent's most stable financial system. Turkey's growing economic strength was matched by an increasingly ambitious and independent foreign policy -- one driven by trade and based on engagement, not confrontation. ``We used to implement other people's programs,'' Mr Gul noted. Iran, with whom Turkey enjoys blossoming trade and from whom it imports one-third of its gas, was a case in point, he said. Mr Gul said Turkey did not believe sanctions would stop Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons and feared they would lead to another disastrous war like that in Iraq. As a neighbour, it stood to lose most, so it had combined with Brazil to broker a confidence-building agreement with Iran on exchanging uranium. ``We thought it would be appreciated,'' Mr Gul said. When the US and its European allies pressed ahead with UN sanctions anyway, ``we were surprised''. Turkey voted against the sanctions to keep its own deal on the table. Turkey's growing activism in its own backyard has served it well. Its trade with the Middle East has jumped from $US1.9 billion in 1991 to more than $US23bn last year. Trade with Iran has risen more than 500 per cent since 2002, with about 75,000 trucks a year crossing their mutual border. Turkey's standing in the region has soared, with Mr Erdogan lauded for standing up to Israel. Turkish TV is now watched across the Middle East, and relaxed visa restrictions mean Arabs are flocking to Turkey. Mr Gul argued that the West should welcome this, saying that millions of Arabs were comparing Turkey's success with that of their own countries'. ``Our friends in the West should appreciate that Turkey is indirectly spreading all these values in our neighbourhood,'' he said."
203,The Nation (AsiaNet),2010-01-10,Zardari seeks UK help for access to EU markets,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,Vol. XXIII No. 338,"November 23, 2011",478  words,"President Asif Ali Zardari has said that Britain and Pakistan need to work closely to further strengthen the relationship in various areas particularly in trade, investment and educational development with a view to eliminating militancy and terrorism from Pakistan and promoting peace and security in the region. The President said this during his meeting with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband who called on him here at Bilawal House on Sunday evening shortly after the President had returned from a two-day visit to Syria. Spokesperson of the President, former Senator Farhat ullah Babar said that matters relating to the forthcoming London Conference on Afghanistan, bilateral issues and regional issues, the ongoing fight against militancy and the second Pak-EU Summit also figured in the meeting. Zardari said that any initiative on Afghanistan should ensure Afghan ownership of the process as well as territorial integrity of that country, national reconciliation, peace and stability and that its soil was not used against any of its neighbours. The President said that an important issue was that of border management between Pakistan and Afghanistan in which the international community could be of great help. Zardari underlined the need for setting up Reconstruction Opportunity Zones (ROZs) in the tribal belt with the facility to export the manufactured goods to the markets of European Union countries. This, the President said, will help address the issues of poverty and unemployment in the Tribal Areas as an adjunct to stabilise and manage the border. The President also called for Afghan peace and integration programme which offered incentives to the over two million Afghan refugees in Pakistan to return to their country. In the bilateral issues, the President also underlined the need for reducing the time span for the processing of Pakistani visa applications particularly that of students and businessmen as well as addressing the perception of discrimination in the issuance of British visas. Earlier, Miliband said Karachi was the financial hub of Pakistan and the recent incidents of killing were damaging its image. Talking to the media after laying floral wreath at the mausoleum of the Quaid-i-Azam, Miliband underscored immediate check on the incidents of violence, asserting that political tension in the metropolis should end forthwith. The visiting Chief British Diplomat said: ""We wish to see a lot of Pakistani students coming to Britain to seek education."" Earlier, he called on Sindh Governor Dr Ishratul Ebad at the Governor House and exchanged views with him on issues of mutual interest and bilateral ties between Pakistan and Britain. The Governor apprised the visiting Foreign Secretary of ongoing development projects and trade activities in Sindh. In addition, Sindh Governor also presented a souvenir to Miliband."
204,The Daily Telegraph (Australia),2010-12-01,Furry microphones can sneak up on a leader,1 - State Edition,DTM,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,FEATURES; Pg. 65,"November 30, 2010",640  words,"JULIAN Assange has angered several world leaders by leaking more documents through his Wikileaks website. One of the most embarrassing aspects of his leaks this time is that they include candid, and sometimes wildly inaccurate, US assessments of world leaders and foreign nations. Occasionally politicians are too frank in their assessments of foreign leaders. In a 1931 Times article Britain's Winston Churchill summed up Indian nationalist Mahatma Gandhi: ``It is alarming and also nauseating to see Mr Gandhi, a seditious Middle Temple lawyer of the type well-known in the East, now posing as a fakir, striding half naked up the steps of the vice-regal palace to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor.'' As prime minister, Churchill would change his attitude toward the ``fakir''. US president George H.W. Bush was often caught out saying things he later regretted; he eventually became wary of saying too much in public. In 1991 he was overheard explaining the dangers of microphones to then political hopeful Arnold Schwarzenegger: ``These, they're very dangerous. They trap you. Especially these furry ones . . . it's these furry guys that get you in real trouble. They can reach out and listen to something so -- keep it respectful here.'' He had been caught before. As vice-president, while being shown around Auschwitz in 1987, he blurted: ``Boy, they were big on crematoriums weren't they?'' Once he tried to show off his women's lib credentials, saying: ``But let me tell you, this gender thing is history. You're looking at a guy who sat down with [British prime minister] Margaret Thatcher across the table and talked about serious issues.'' It sounded as if he were surprised that women were capable of talking about politics. But to be fair Thatcher, in a famous gaffe, derided the majority of politicians on the planet: ``One thing that politics has taught me is that men are not a reasoned or reasonable sex.'' Bush's son, George W. Bush, was once quoted as saying: ``This foreign policy stuff is a little frustrating,'' which was probably because he understood so little about the world. He once asked Brazilian president Fernando Cardoso: ``Do you have blacks, too?'' In 2006 an informal chat with British PM Tony Blair about Hezbollah rocket attacks on Israel was picked up by a microphone. Bush said: ``The irony is, what they really need to do is to get Syria to get Hezbollah to stop doing this s..., and it's over.'' The discussion went on for a short while longer before Blair noticed the microphone was on and switched it off. Republican president Gerald Ford probably lost the 1976 election campaign because of what seemed like ignorance of Cold War Europe. In a presidential debate he said: ``There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never be will under a Ford administration . . . I don't believe the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.'' Ford's Democrat successor Jimmy Carter lost to Californian governor Ronald Reagan partly on the strength of a gaffe that suggested he consulted his daughter Amy over nuclear-weapons policy, but Reagan would be just as gaffe-prone. Despite the tensions between the Soviet Union and the US, Reagan loved to tell Russian jokes, often with the disclaimer that they were gathered from the Russians themselves. But during a sound check for an address given in 1984 he quipped: ``My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.'' While some laughed it off, the Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko was not amused by such a joke from a man in charge of a nuclear arsenal. Reagan continued to spout his Russian jokes when Mikhail Gorbachev emerged as Soviet leader but the two men would have a good working relationship nonetheless."
205,Pittsburgh Tribune Review,2010-11-17,"Asian trade touted for benefits in U.S., abroad",,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"November 17, 2010",492 words,"Despite opposition from some automakers and unions, the United States must press ahead on a free trade agreement with South Korea, a top State Department official said Tuesday. ""We have no choice but to engage at a very strategic level in trade"" with growing Asian markets, Kurt Campbell, assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said in an interview with the Tribune-Review. Campbell earlier spoke to more than 100 Carnegie Mellon University and University of Pittsburgh students in Oakland. President Obama wrapped up a 10-day tour of Asia on Monday that included a stop in South Korea, where he surprised many by failing to announce completion of the trade pact. Campbell cautioned against protectionism, saying one of the hottest-selling items in South Korea is the American-designed iPad, Apple's tablet computer. ""Undeniably, our engagement (with Asian countries) economically and financially will be part of the recovery of the United States over the next five to 10 years,"" Campbell said. Casting a pall over the peninsula is nuclear-armed North Korea's alleged flouting of international sanctions. The United Nations Security Council released a report last week accusing North Korea of shipping weapons -- including ballistic missile components -- to Iran and Syria, among other sanction violations. Campbell called North Korea's behavior ""provocative"" and the U.N. report ""deeply, profoundly worrying."" ""We have seen a series of provocations -- nuclear tests, missile launches, the undeniable facts of the sinking of the Cheonan, the South Korean corvette -- which I think are deeply worrisome,"" Campbell said. Campbell and other U.S. diplomats worked to get China and India to increase pressure on North Korea, a sign of the growing clout of the region's two emerging powers. The rise of China and India ""promises to be one of the most important change in global politics in the last 100 years,"" Campbell said. ""Getting that right will be one of the most important dimensions of American foreign policy over the course of the next 20 to 30 years, and it will be extremely difficult."" Their emergence comes as the United States, burdened by debt and slow economic recovery, is trying to ease the trade imbalance that fueled their historic growth. ""We cannot go back to a situation where we are the purchaser of last resort, where we are basically the engine of global growth,"" Campbell said. ""We no longer have the wherewithal to take on relatively inexpensive Asian capital and then use it to purchase large amounts of (Asian) exports."" In a continent marked by distrust among neighboring countries, however, the United States is viewed as a stabilizing force, Campbell said. Suspicions of the United States, which permeated the region as recently as 20 years ago, gave way to the desire to trade -- in part as a hedge against Chinese dominance, he said. ""They want us engaged,"" Campbell said. ""The door is open for us."""

Once far behind, Mr. Brown seemed to be making a modest comeback when, in the past two weeks, the campaign was shaken by the introduction of an American import: the televised candidates' debate. The beneficiary has been neither Mr. Brown nor Mr. Cameron, but Nicholas Clegg, the leader of Britain's perennially also-ran Liberal Democratic Party. Judged the winner of the debates held this far, Mr. Clegg has suddenly become a contender -- and the election is looking as if it could significantly shift Britain's course. At this point it looks unlikely that Mr. Clegg's party will win the May 6 election and form the next government, if only because of the way Britain's voting system works. But it could force the first ""hung parliament"" since 1974, in which no party has a majority. That could mean messy negotiations over a coalition government, or a weak minority government. Either way Britain could have difficulty forging policies to emerge from the economic crisis or making decisions about its foreign and defense policies. The country is at something of a crossroads: A strategic defense review after the election could decide whether it continues to act as a close partner of the United States in military operations abroad or retreats to a lesser role. Mr. Clegg's stance on those issues could make some in Washington nervous.

208,The Washington Post,2010-07-04,"Biden in Iraq for 4th of July; Meets with officials Troop issues, country's leadership unresolved",Suburban Edition,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,FOREIGN; Pg. A14,"July 4, 2010",696 words,"Vice President Biden made a surprise visit to Baghdad on Saturday for the July Fourth holiday in the midst of a political deadlock nearly four months after Iraq's national election. Biden arrived at a time when many are questioning whether the U.S. policy in Iraq is adrift. Some Iraqi officials say they worry that the United States is concerned only about its exit from Iraq, and not the country's still shaky democracy, as its focus shifts toward the war in Afghanistan. ""A distant policy in this country is deemed as a weakness and also deemed as a failure,"" said Fawzi Hariri, Iraq's minister of industry. ""It gives the wrong message to Syria and Iran, and it will give the wrong message to the Taliban."" Biden's visit, his fourth here as vice president, may be a signal to Iraq that the U.S. administration is still engaged. A White House statement said Biden would celebrate the holiday with the troops but also ""reaffirm"" the ""long-term"" U.S. commitment to Iraq and discuss recent developments. Biden and his wife, Jill, were greeted by U.S. Ambassador Christopher R. Hill; Gen. Ray Odierno, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq; Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari; and two other senior military commanders. At Odierno's residence, where Biden met with Hill and the general, Biden said he was ""optimistic"" about the formation of a ""representative"" Iraqi government. ""In one sense, it looks the most difficult putting the government together. In another sense, this is local politics. This is not a lot different than any other government,"" Biden said. ""The parties are all talking."" On Sunday, Biden will meet with former prime minister Ayad Allawi and Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who are vying for Iraq's top job. Biden will meet with other Iraqi officials during his visit as well as spend time with the troops on the holiday. ""We're not here to offer a plan or solution. We are here to hear what the Iraqis have to say and to offer our advice if they want it,"" a senior administration official said. Secular Shiite Allawi's Iraqiya bloc won the most seats in parliament in the March elections, with a razor-thin lead over Maliki's political bloc. Some say the two are nearing a deal that could break the deadlock. But others worry that without more U.S. pressure, neither will compromise enough to form a government. ""Even the most nationalist figures want American pressure right now,"" said Ezzat al Shahbandar, a Shiite from Maliki's State of Law bloc who is involved in political negotiations. ""The Americans need to interfere now because the atmosphere is seething and we see no solution soon."" Senior administration officials traveling with Biden dismissed the criticism and said they were engaged daily -- hourly -- in Iraq. They also said there is no ""link"" between a scheduled drawdown of U.S. troops to 50,000 by the end of the summer and the formation of Iraq's government. It is unclear when a government will be formed as political leaders make back-room deals for the top jobs. ""While the combat mission will be ending, the presence of combat troops will not. We're not flipping a light switch on Aug. 31,"" the senior administration official said. ""Whether or not there is a government doesn't change the plans that we have to end the combat mission and be down to 50,000."" There are 77,500 troops in Iraq, according to Iraq's top U.S. military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Stephen Lanza. At the height of the troop ""surge,"" more than 165,000 troops were in the country. ""The Americans are leaving, and really right now is the most sensitive and critical time in Iraq's history,"" a senior Iraqi government official said. ""It is a disaster if you just pick up and go without ensuring that an inclusive government is formed. They have to do more."" Biden's last visit to Iraq was widely criticized. He arrived after a series of Sunni and secular candidates were barred from running in the elections because of their supposed links to Saddam Hussein's outlawed Baath party. Biden left without a solution to what was seen as a political crisis that deepened sectarian tensions, Iraqi officials said at the time. Special correspondent Jinan Hussein contributed to this report."
209,The Straits Times (Singapore),2010-01-22,Turkey causing a flap in Europe; The country is increasingly aligning itself with Islamic and anti-Western regimes,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,WORLD,"January 21, 2010",853 words,"In theory, Turkish-Israeli relations are now on the mend. But the spat between the two countries is carefully watched in other capitals. For, although nobody condones Israel's boorish behaviour, frustrations with the conduct of Turkey's current foreign policy are widely shared among Western governments. Since its establishment in 1923 out of the ruins of its old empire, Turkey has usually portrayed itself as a European nation which just happens to be Muslim. It joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), the US-dominated military alliance, regarded its Middle Eastern neighbours with suspicion, and forged close military links with Israel. And it shunned Islam; to this day, women wearing scarves are banned from the higher ranks of the civil service. Matters changed when the Justice and Development Party (AKP), a mildly Islamic political movement, came to power in 2003. It was clear from the start that AKP represented a genuine social revolution, by the country's poorer people against the old and frequently corrupt political establishment. For a while, AKP kept foreign policy unchanged. Turkey continued to aspire to membership in the European Union. And Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the AKP leader, was more concerned with defending himself against repeated challenges from the staunchly secular Turkish military. But the Turkish generals - who toppled every previous Islamic leadership - have found their match in Mr Erdogan, a shrewd political survivor. Secure at home and assisted by Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu - one of the brightest diplomatic experts the country ever had - Mr Erdogan soon unleashed a radical new international approach. The Turkish leader no longer sees his nation as a 'bridge' between East and West as his predecessors have done, but as a 'dynamic regional hub in a rapidly changing world where fundamental power is shifting away from the West', says Mr Mehmet Ogutcu, a former senior diplomat. Links with Central Asian republics - whose people are all of Turkish ethnic origins - flourished. More spectacularly, a policy of 'zero problems with neighbours' was applied; in quick order, Turkey settled its differences with both Iran and Iraq and, only last week, it abolished visa requirements with Syria, hitherto its biggest regional rival. Leading the world's 17th-biggest economy, Mr Erdogan no longer feels that he has to beg to be admitted into Europe; if the EU does not want his country, Turkey can find plenty of allies among Muslim nations. As a former US ambassador to Turkey put it, 'the current government sees itself as the tribune of the Muslim world to the West, and not as an emissary of the West to the Muslims'. Initially, Turkey's Western allies welcomed these developments; they argued that a country which is confident in its own Islamic identity would be more stable. Nevertheless, they are beginning to get annoyed by some of Turkey's recent actions. Mr Erdogan described the way China handled the violent riots in Xinjiang last July as 'a kind of genocide'. Yet, seemingly oblivious to the contradiction, he defended Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir against charges of war crimes by arguing that 'Muslims do not commit genocide'. The Turkish leader led international criticism at the publication in Danish newspapers of cartoons offensive to Islam. However, in Turkey itself, television continues to air dramas which show Israeli forces kidnapping children and shooting old men. And Mr Erdogan himself recently told Turkish university students that they should work hard but try not to be like 'money-grubbing' Jews. Turkey was also the first nation to congratulate Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on his controversial re-election last year, and remains the only Nato member which denies that Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons. The problem, argues Dr Soner Cagaptay, a scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in the US, is not that Turkey 'empathises with Muslims, for that would be quite normal', but rather that it 'chooses to align itself with Islamist and anti-Western regimes'. Last week's diplomatic spat with Israel has only improved Mr Erdogan's popularity at home, and his standing among Arabs in the Middle East. But it has also prompted a deeper debate in Western capitals about Turkey's overall direction. So it may not be entirely coincidental that the EU has just chosen Istanbul - Turkey's biggest city - as the European Capital of Culture for this year. The award was amply deserved; Istanbul is an architectural jewel. But the political message was also clear: a discreet reminder to Prime Minister Erdogan that his country is still part of Europe. jonathan.eyal@gmail.com The Turkish leader no longer sees his nation as a 'bridge' between East and West as his predecessors have done, but as a 'dynamic regional hub in a rapidly changing world where fundamental power is shifting away from the West'."
210,The Daily Star (Lebanon),2010-05-01,Clinton expects resumption of indirect Mideast talks next week,,23,Newspaper,,Daily Star Staff,ENGLISH,,"July 8, 2010",459  words,"""We will be starting with proximity talks next week,"" Clinton told reporters, saying US special envoy George Mitchell would return to the Middle East next week to get the process under way. Clinton said the US expected an Arab foreign ministers meeting on Saturday to endorse the new talks, which would give Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas political cover to resume indirect negotiations that he pulled out of in March after Israel announced new Jewish settlement construction. ""Ultimately we want to see the parties in direct negotiations and working out all the difficult issues,"" Clinton said during a meeting with visiting Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammad al-Sabah. ""They've been close a few times before,"" Clinton said. ""So we are looking to see resumption of those discussions."" Israeli and Palestinian officials declined comment. One Abbas aide, Saeb Erekat, said his side would await the results of the Arab foreign ministers meeting on Saturday as well as of a Palestinian Liberation Organization executive committee next week. Sheikh Mohammad said he was confident Arab states would back the initiative to get talks back on track. ""We support fully the position that the United States has taken,"" he said. Clinton's statement signaled that weeks of intense US diplomacy were bearing fruit and both sides were again ready to relaunch the peace process through indirect ""proximity"" talks - in which US mediators shuttle between negotiators. ""We've worked intensively in this. We've asked both sides to take actions,"" said State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley. ""I think there's an understanding that the proximity talks are valuable. I think there's a commitment to engage seriously in them and to begin to address the substantive issues at the heart of the search for peace,"" he said. Mitchell, who held three days of talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders last week, was expected to travel again in coming days and would have meetings in the region toward the end of next week, Crowley said. The Obama administration has been pushing hard for the two sides to resume negotiations stalled since the three-week Gaza war that began in December 2008, calling it a direct security concern to the United States. Hopes that indirect talks would start in March were dashed when Israeli officials announced plans to build 1,600 new homes for Jewish settlers, ignoring American and Palestinian objections. Abbas had long insisted that Israel freeze Jewish settlement building before the talks resume, and had rejected a temporary hiatus in construction ordered by Netanyahu last year as insufficient. But Palestinian sources have said that Mitchell offered them an unwritten commitment to assign blame publicly to any party that takes actions which compromise the negotiations in exchange for coming back to the table. Clinton declined to discuss any specific US offers to the Palestinians, but said that both sides recognized the importance the Obama administration placed on reaching a peace deal which eventually delivers independent states for both Israel and the Palestinians. ""We've been very clear in our efforts that the resumption of talks is absolutely essential for the progress we seek toward a two state solution,"" she said. Late Thursday, Clinton said Arab states should offer more moral and financial support to Palestinians, reach out to Israelis and stop arming militants to foster Middle East peace. In her third speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in two months, Clinton stressed American support for Israel after a period of acute US-Israeli tension while laying out actions she expects of Israel, the Palestinians and Arab countries. Clinton's speech appeared designed to quell any lingering anxiety in the American Jewish community about Obama's support for Israel and to make the case for why peace is necessary for the two parties and the broader region. ""Arab states ... have an interest in a stable and secure region and they should take specific steps that show Israelis, Palestinians and their own people that peace is possible and that there will be tangible benefits if it is achieved,"" Clinton said in a speech to the American Jewish Committee. ""We would hope to see such concrete steps like the opening or reopening of commercial trade offices and interest sections, overflight rights, postal routes, and more people-to-people exchanges that build trust at the grassroots level,"" Clinton added on Friday. Clinton also urged Arab states to give Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas greater moral support to negotiate with Israel and more financial backing to help Prime Minister Salam Fayyad build functioning Palestinian institutions. Clinton also repeated US accusations that Syria has transferred arms to Hizbullah, the political and militant group that controls parts of southern Lebanon, and said Syrian President Bashar Assad was ""making decisions that could mean war or peace for the region."" In what appeared to be a reference to Iran, Clinton also said that no state should arm Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls the Gaza Strip. - Reuters 211 of 266 DOCUMENTS The Daily Star (Lebanon) June 5, 2010 Saturday Hittites with iPods: Why Turkey matters Just as Iran has emerged as a more significant regional power after the Iraq war of 2003, Turkey in the past two years has emerged as a more dynamic, respected and powerful regional player, and the events of the past week off the Gaza coast have only accelerated this process. The third non-Arab power in the Middle East - Israel - seems to be moving in the opposite direction Just as Iran has emerged as a more significant regional power after the Iraq war of 2003, Turkey in the past two years has emerged as a more dynamic, respected and powerful regional player, and the events of the past week off the Gaza coast have only accelerated this process. The third non-Arab power in the Middle East - Israel - seems to be moving in the opposite direction, generating increasingly vocal international criticisms and demands for investigations into its behavior, while many of its leaders are cancelling trips abroad for fear of being indicted for war crimes. Of these three countries, Turkey strikes me as the most interesting and important, because its growing prominence includes a combination of respect, credibility and democratic legitimacy that Iran and Israel do not fully share. Much international media and political analysis speaks incorrectly of Turkey and Iran as either hegemons or role models for the rest of the Middle East. They are neither, because non-Arab states, even Muslim-majority ones, cannot expect to define how power is exercised, relations configured, interests determined, or identity expressed in the Arab world. Turkey, though, now enjoys greater respect and appreciation around the region, because it approaches most closely that cherished goal that has eluded every Arab country and Iran since the age of independence dawned nearly a century ago: genuine nationalism, combined with democratic governance and Islamic values, in a context of clear modernity and secularism. Turkey is Hittites with iPods - a strong national identity anchored in ancient traditions in the land, yet combined with modern values and behavior that accentuate its power, efficacy and impact on others in the neighborhood. The Israeli attack last Monday on a Turkish ship in the humanitarian aid convoy heading for Gaza, which resulted in the killing of eight Turks and one Turkish American, heightened the strains between Israel and Turkey that had been building during the past year - largely due to Turkey's disapproval of Israel's war and then siege of Gaza. Turkey criticized Israel's policies toward the Palestinians while also mediating seriously between Israel and Syria. In other words, it conducted a mature, nuanced foreign policy that avoided simplistic, black-and-white, ""you're with us or against us"" attitudes. Rather, it patiently maneuvered itself into situations where it could serve its own national interests while also playing a constructive role in the region. The latest example of this was the recent Turkish-Brazilian mediation with Iran over the latter's nuclear industry. The two states succeeded where the United States, the Europeans and relevant United Nations agencies had not been able to, by convincing Iran to agree to send low-grade enriched uranium abroad for conversion into fuel for a nuclear research reactor. The development of a stronger regional diplomatic role for Turkey, allowing it to operate with credibility and integrity among Israelis, Arabs, Iranians and Western powers, has reflected a brand of self-confident national assertion that in turn is anchored in that combination of attributes that Turkey alone enjoys in the entire Middle East: genuine nationalism, stable and strong statehood, economic and military power, democratic and constitutional governance, public secularism and private Islamism. Turkey has also operated regionally in a manner that seeks to protect its own legitimate national strategic interests, without appearing to be aggressive or predatory to its neighbors. This is significant because of the historical mixed feelings in the Arab world about the four centuries of Ottoman control of key parts of this region. A remarkable feat of the current Justice and Development Party that rules Turkey has been its successful repositioning of Turkey among its skeptical and suspicious Arab neighbors. As my colleague and friend Tarek Yousef, the dean of the Dubai School of Government, noted the other day: ""[T]his government in Turkey in the past three years has erased hundreds of years of Arab suspicion of the Turks, an amazing achievement that should not be overlooked."" Turkey's strong and repeated public criticism of Israeli policies reached a new peak after this week's Israeli attack against Turkish ships and nationals in international waters. Turkey's government will now enjoy greater respect and accolades from Arab public opinion, but like the stronger Iran of recent years it will not be able to translate this heightened appreciation into any kind of greater direct impact on the region - which is not one of its stated goals, in any case. Many international analysts or commentators are wrongly looking to Iran and Turkey as potential new hegemons or role models in the Arab-majority Middle East region, but these are the wrong attributes or roles to look for. No Arab country shows the inclination to adopt Turkish-style secular, republican and democratic constitutionalism, or the ability to adopt Iranian-style technological prowess and political defiance of the West. Turkey and Iran, in their different ways, are noteworthy because they practice genuinely sovereign decision- and policymaking - something that eludes, but should entice, the Arab world. Rami G.

Were Hizbullah to procure extra support and jurisdiction, Connelly said, Lebanon would witness ""a future defined by violence, a vision that is both fueled and funded by an outside power with its own negative agenda."" Connelly, whose nomination for ambassadorship in Lebanon still needs ratifying by President Barack Obama, outlined her aims for when she is embedded in Beirut. She will replace Ambassador Michelle Sison, who is expected to leave her post in the coming weeks. ""My experiences lead me to believe that despite the numerous sources of conflict in the Middle East, many in the region yearn for a brighter future and a realization of a just, lasting and comprehensive Middle East peace,"" Connelly said. ""I will support the Lebanese in their efforts to achieve this goal."" Connelly has served with US diplomatic missions in occupied Jerusalem, Amman and Damascus, but a post in Lebanon would easily be the most significant of her career. Her appointment comes at a time of increased tensions between Hizbullah and Israel, as well as amid stalled domestic discussions on the issue of Hizbullah's arms. ""The cleavages of the post-2005 period may be starting to blur in the eyes of many in Lebanon and in the region but the options for Lebanon remain stark nonetheless: Should the future of Lebanon be in the hands of leaders who ... want to put their energies into restoring the state institutions that can provide for and protect the Lebanese?"" Connelly asked. ""Or, should Lebanon's future be in the hands of those who preach eternal resistance? ""US assistance to Lebanon over the past five years has been unapologetically directed at transparently supporting those Lebanese leaders who want to build a strong Lebanon."" Connelly also envisaged further reform of public administrations and institutions, following parliamentary elections in June last year which were hailed internationally as a success. ""Under President [Barack] Obama, US commitment to Lebanon remains strong. Economic and political reform are crucial to strengthening Lebanon, to building the institutions of the state, and restoring the role of the central government in the lives of all Lebanese,"" she said. Connelly also called for increased electoral reform ""to overcome the skepticism of the Lebanese people about the democratic process."" She reiterated that US support for the work of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, created to try the killers of five-time Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and the cause of much political bickering in recent weeks. She also stayed true to US Middle East envoy George Mitchell's comments earlier this year regarding Lebanon's 400,000 registered Palestinian refugees, over whom debate has raged this month. ""The United States will not support the forced naturalization of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon,"" Connelly said. 213 of 266 DOCUMENTS The Daily Star (Lebanon) August 3, 2010 Tuesday Israel fears Turks could pass its military secrets to Iran OCCUPIED JERUSALEM: Israel's Defense Minister Ehud Barak has voiced concern that once-stalwart ally Turkey could share Israeli intelligence secrets with Iran, revealing a deep distrust as Ankara's regional interests shift. The leaked comments by Barak cast doubt on how much Israel is willing or able to reconcile with Turks outraged at its Dan Williams Reuters OCCUPIED JERUSALEM: Israel's Defense Minister Ehud Barak has voiced concern that once-stalwart ally Turkey could share Israeli intelligence secrets with Iran, revealing a deep distrust as Ankara's regional interests shift. The leaked comments by Barak cast doubt on how much Israel is willing or able to reconcile with Turks outraged at its navy's killing of nine of their compatriots aboard an aid ship that tried to break the Gaza Strip blockade on May 31. Until relations soured, Turkey had been the Muslim power closest to Israel, a friendship largely based on military cooperation and intelligence sharing. In a closed-door briefing to activists aligned with his center-left Labour Party at a kibbutz near Jerusalem on July 25, Barak still called Turkey a ""friend and major strategic ally."" But he described Hakan Fidan, the new head of its National Intelligence Organization, as a ""friend of Iran."" ""There are quite a few secrets of ours [entrusted to Turkey] and the thought that they could become open to the Iranians over the next several months, let's say, is quite disturbing,"" he said in a segment of the speech broadcast by Army Radio. Barak was speaking in the context of past Israeli-Turkish intelligence cooperation, an audience member told Reuters on Monday. An Israeli defense official said the event was private and that the aired recording of Barak had not been authorized. Appointed in May, Fidan was previously a foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, whose AK Party has roots in political Islam and has often censured Israel. Political sources in Ankara said that Fidan, a former envoy to the UN nuclear watchdog, was also involved in a Turkish- and Brazilian-brokered compromise proposal - received coolly in the West - to curb Iran's controversial uranium enrichment. Israel has hinted at last-ditch military strikes to deny the Iranians the means to make a nuclear bomb - a threat boosted by its 2007 air raid on an alleged atomic reactor in Syria, during which Israeli warplanes briefly flew over Turkish territory. The Erdogan government was angered by that incursion and has pointed to Israel's own assumed nuclear arsenal. Such positions have rallied Arabs and Muslims around Turkey, a NATO member. Ali Nihat Ozcan of the Ankara-based TEPAV think tank saw in Barak's remarks an effort at ""psychological pressure"" on Turkey. ""If somebody like Barak has voiced such concerns it shows a blockage in the intelligence sharing channels,"" he said. ""There is a paranoia that Turkey could share with Iran what it could have shared with Israel before, regarding Iran's nuclear program."" Ankara has not commented publicly on the state of its intelligence ties with Israel. But some Turkish commentators have looked askance at media reports of Israeli collaboration with Kurds in northern Iraq, given their suspected ties to Turkey's separatist Kurdish guerrilla group, PKK. By contrast, Israel's Mossad spy agency was widely reputed to have helped Turkey to capture PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in 1999, though then-Mossad chief Efraim Halevy denied involvement. There has also been ridicule in Turkey of an Israeli inquiry into the interception of the pro-Palestinian aid ship Mavi Marmara, which faulted military intelligence for not anticipating passengers' resistance to the naval boarding party. Marines shot dead nine Turks in the ensuing struggle on deck, an action Israel has justified as self-defense. Turkey, which withdrew its ambassador and suspended joint military exercises with Israel in protest, has demanded an apology and an international investigation. 214 of 266 DOCUMENTS Right Vision News July 4, 2010 Sunday EU membership vital for Turkey: Gul London, July 4 -- Turkey has hit back at accusations that it is turning its back on the West in favour of closer ties with the Islamic world, insisting that membership of the EU is its key foreign policy goal. ""There is no reason to have any doubts about Turkey,"" Abdullah Gul, the President, declared in a forceful interview with The Times designed to allay alarm in Europe and America about its increasingly close relations with radical Middle East regimes. Turkey was not ""lost"", he said, denouncing such claims as ""unacceptable"" and stressing that Turkey was also forging ties far beyond the Arab world. ""I consider it very wrong to interpret Turkey's interests with other geographic regions as it breaking from the West, turning its back on the West or seeking alternatives to the West. Turkey is part of Europe."" Mr Gul argued that the US and Europe should welcome its growing engagement in the Middle East because it was promoting Western values in a region largely governed by authoritarian regimes. Rebuking some Western politicians for their outdated views of Turkey, he insisted that the country had undergone a ""silent revolution"". It was now a big economic power that had embraced democracy, human rights and the free market. It had become a ""source of inspiration"" in the region. ""If this is not acknowledged, it's a pity,"" Mr Gul lamented. Turkey is a strategically vital country of 72 million people that straddles the border of Europe and Asia, has Nato's second-largest army and is a supply hub for US war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. It has also caused consternation in Western capitals in recent months. Not only has it welcomed President Ahmadinejad of Iran and congratulated him on his stolen election victory, it also voted against UN sanctions to try to halt the Iranian nuclear programme. The nation has lent support to Hamas, which is on the US and EU lists of terrorist organisations. ""We are respecting the choice of the Palestinian people in Gaza,"" Mr Gul said. It was preparing to host President al-Bashir of Sudan, who is wanted for crimes against humanity, at an Islamic conference until the EU objected. It has assiduously courted Syria, with whom it nearly went to war in 1998. At the same time, Turkey has condemned Israel, formerly its closest regional ally and supplier of much of its military hardware, over its invasion of Gaza and the recent killing of nine Turkish civilians on a Gaza-bound flotilla by Israeli commandos. Apart from one secret ministerial meeting this week, relations are frozen, with Turkey demanding an apology and compensation Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

215,Daily Times (PK),2010-08-07,VIEW: Has our foreign policy failed? -Mohammad Jamil,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"August 6, 2010",,"Pakistan, Aug. 7 -- Though a majority of political parties and leaders in Pakistan wish to have cordial relations with the US and the west, a great number of people do not like the way they resort to arm-twisting and using a long stick and a short carrot Our foreign policy has been susceptible to manipulation because of internal political and economic instability brought about by flawed policies of successive governments that looked towards western nations or the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) for aid and loans. Our dependency syndrome has been the reason for buckling under the pressure exerted by the US after 9/11. The objective of any country's foreign policy is to have cordial relations with other nations, especially neighbouring ones, and to safeguard its own national security, independence and sovereignty. Pakistan's foreign policy has been flawed since the very beginning. In the 1950s, Arab countries like Egypt, Syria, Libya, etc, were unhappy with Pakistan because it had joined the Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO) and Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO), and entered into a bilateral agreement with the US. The newly independent and non-aligned nations were suspicious of our role; the socialist bloc considered Pakistan as their enemy, and the US-led western powers thought of Pakistan as no more than a pawn in the international political chessboard. Today, the US and other western countries as well as Iran and Afghanistan suspect that Pakistan is working against their interests in order to protect its own. Despite our tremendous sacrifices in the war against terror, the west is still pushing Pakistan to the precipice. As if the innuendos by members of the Obama administration were not enough, British Prime Minister (PM) David Cameron accused Pakistan of exporting terrorism during his recent visit to India. Had he passed such remarks in Britain, one would not have seen a debate raging in the media nor the anger on the streets because the nation is quite used to disparaging remarks and insults heaped on Pakistan by the US. The furore has been unleashed by his presence in a rival country. On Monday, the foreign minister summoned the British high commissioner (HC). Keeping in view the seriousness of the matter, 'inviting' the HC to the Foreign Office was not enough. To lodge a protest and show displeasure, the meeting with the additional secretary of foreign affairs would have been more appropriate. According to the official statement given later, Shah Mehmood Qureshi 'explained' to HC Adam Thomson that ""terrorism was a global issue that had to be dealt with in a spirit of cooperation"". Mr Thomson is reported to have said that Britain wanted to have good and cordial relations with Pakistan. But this is no explanation. To make things worse, the PM Cameron's spokeswoman said, ""He (Cameron) was referring to elements within Pakistan supporting terrorism, not the Pakistani government,"" while adding that the PM stood by his statement. Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari has met Mr Cameron though a considerable section of the public and intelligentsia were opposed to the trip. Questions were raised about Zardari's embarking on trips abroad while numerous catastrophes are clobbering the people at home. In such conditions, scheduled meetings are normally postponed. On his outrageous charge sheet against Pakistan in India, David Cameron drew flak from some elements in Britain for showing disregard to diplomatic norms. Britain's former Foreign Secretary David Miliband had also taken exception to the PM's remarks, describing them as foolish and undiplomatic. Miliband reportedly said, ""There is a difference in straight talk and being a loudmouth."" He also advised Cameron to understand that ""a man is endowed with one mouth and two ears, and he should use them in that proportion"". But our political leaders are oblivious to fact that the country is in dire straits, blighted not only by galloping lawlessness, crime, extremism and terrorism but also by a sagging economy, runaway inflation, rampant unemployment and mounting poverty. Externally, the country is being held to account for the foibles, lapses and failures of others in the fight against terrorism and is being pressurised to do what they themselves should have done. To say the least, the challenges that the nation faces both at home and abroad are gigantic and daunting. If the ruling elite does not change course and keeps on treading down the beaten track, the country is sure to hit the rocks, for which posterity will never forgive them. Our leadership should also learn to guard national honour and dignity in relation to other nations. In January 2010, Israel had summoned Turkey's envoy to express its anger at a Turkish television series depicting Israeli agents and diplomats trying to kidnap and convert Muslim children. Without informing the ambassador, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Daniel Ayalon invited the media as well, seating the ambassador across a table with only the Israeli flag on it. On this, Turkey had threatened to recall its representative from Israel over such humiliation. When Ayalon refused to tender an apology, Israeli President Shimon Peres and PM Benjamin Netanyahu persuaded the foreign ministry to issue a clear apology, which it finally did. Though a majority of political parties and leaders in Pakistan wish to have cordial relations with the US and the west, a great number of people do not like the way they resort to arm-twisting and using a long stick and a short carrot. In contrast, our leaders, whether in government or in the opposition, only mumble when they are supposed to raise their voices. Only the military has expressed its anger by cancelling the trip of the Inter Services Intelligence's higher-ups to Britain. Whether the government functionaries take note of the badmouthing that Pakistan has been receiving lately, and also go through the allegations contained in the WikiLeaks documents with a view to understanding the real motives behind their actions remains to be seen.

216,The Irish Times,2010-06-09,Abbas to seek Obama backing for direct talks with Israel,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,WORLD; Pg. 11,"June 8, 2010",608 words,"PALESTINIAN president Mahmoud Abbas is due to meet US president Barack Obama at the White House today to discuss efforts to relaunch direct negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis. Mr Abbas flew to Washington from Ankara, where he offered Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan condolences for the nine Turkish nationals killed last week during Israel s commando raid on a six-ship aid convoy attempting to break the siege of Gaza. Mr Abbas accused Israel of state terrorism , and asked how long would Palestinians have to bear Israeli land confiscations, expulsions from their homes, and the siege of Gaza. Although the State Department characterised as constructive and substantive the latest round of proximity talks conducted by US envoy George Mitchell, Mr Abbas called the exchanges difficult, and said there were lots of obstacles to progress. Due to Israel s military action against the flotilla, he has come under increasing pressure from the Palestinian public, elements in his Fatah movement, and Hamas to call off the talks. However, for Mr Abbas as well as for Mr Obama and Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, further talks are essential. Mahdi Abdel Hadi, head of a Palestinian think tank based in East Jerusalem, said the US cannot afford rejection of the peace process by Palestinians and Arabs who could abrogate the moribund 1993 Oslo accords or withdraw the 2002 Arab land-for-peace plan. Israel, Dr Abdel Hadi observed, understands the need to keep these agreements in play. They provide recognition and security, and protect US regional interests. The US, he stated, is determined to keep Fatah in power . Over the past five years Washington has build up the capacity of Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces, and bankrolled the authority, Dr Abdel Hadi said. As long as Mitchell comes, Israel will observe a partial freeze in construction in Jerusalem and the [West Bank] settlements. This keeps the idea of withdrawal to the 1967 border alive, he said, while putting pressure on Israeli public opinion to accept this proposition, and challenging Israel s right-wing government. Dr Abdel Hadi said the US policy seemed to be: If we can t change Israel s stance, the Israeli government will have to change, by dropping right-wingers and bringing in centrists. While it is engaged in negotiations with the PA, the US hopes Israel will not attack Hizbullah in Lebanon, Syria or Iran. Israel cannot have war and work for peace at the same time, Dr Abdel Hadi remarked. Finally, if, as expected, proximity talks fail, the PA is counting on the US to convene an international conference which will seek to impose a solution based on the framework for a deal reached in negotiations during the Clinton administration and between Mr Abbas and former Israeli premier Ehud Olmert. A solution, Dr Abdel Hadi stated, would involve land swaps and the deployment of Nato forces. However, he reflected the view of most Palestinians when he said the stated goal of the talks, emergence of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, is no longer possible due to the situation on the ground created by the half million settlers planted in the territories Israel conquered in 1967. Today we have an apartheid system, he said. [The US, Israel and the PA] are trying to manage it so it does not become permanent. Palestinians were living in a prison where they cannot do anything without Israel s permission . They have grey leaders who are open to any suggestion to stay in power, and there is the danger that a radical Taliban culture could develop. The only way this could be averted was to end the occupation, he said."

218,The Herald (Harare),2010-11-17,Elections and Propaganda Frameworks [opinion],,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"November 18, 2010",,"Elections in developing countries often face interference from the outside world, especially from Western countries as led by the headquarters of the imperial authority, the United States. Some of these elections are held in friendly client states to legitimise their rulers and regimes, and a good example is the recent Afghanistan election, where it did not matter that Hamid Karzai's supporters openly cheated by multiple voting, and that Karzai himself openly admitted that the election was fraudulent; nevertheless ""a victory for the Afghan people"". There is no irony here; fraudulent US-backed victory is always supposed to be the pride of the receiving nation, not least because all that comes from Washington must always be good for the unpeople of this world. Other elections are in disfavoured or enemy countries and these are often used to discredit the political systems of these unwanted countries. The elections held in Zimbabwe since 2000 are widely discredited in the West, not because they are any much different to elections held in other African countries over the same period. Rather they are discredited because Zimbabwe is considered to pose ""an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States"", a description for which countries like Nicaragua, Chile, Iraq and others have in the past been severely punished. Morgan Tsvangirai is calling for a Zimbabwe election that is extensively sponsored and managed by Western countries, or, as he describes them, ""the international community"". If Tsvangirai had his way in Zimbabwe, (something absolutely unlikely given the revolutionary resolve of the nationalist Zanu-PF), the sponsorship and management of elections by the US in a foreign country would not be a first at all, but would happen in Zimbabwe all the same. In 1966, the Dominican Republic had US-sponsored and organised elections and these were called ""demonstration elections"". These are basically elections held in client states, defined as elections whose primary function is to convince the home population that the intervention of the United States is well-intentioned, even that the populace of the invaded and occupied countries welcome the intrusion and that they are being given a democratic choice. One can read George W. Bush's memoirs to see how he holds that the greater vision of ""democratising"" Iraq far outweighs the blatant lies on whose basis the country was invaded and wrecked to the ground. In fact the ""democratisation"" far outweighs more than a million lives that were taken away by the mere presence of Western occupiers in Iraq. The United States had other demonstration elections in El Salvador in 1982 and in 1984, just like they had in Guatemala in 1984/85. These elections were used to enhance an image of democracy as preached by Washington. By contrast, Nicaragua had an election funded and organised by the Sandinistas, a government that the Reagan administration wanted to destabilise and overthrow. Understandably, the United States went to unbelievable pains to cast the Nicaraguan election in bad light. It is like a Mugabe-called election in Zimbabwe. That election will be funded and organised by the Zimbabwean Government and its conduct will have absolutely nothing to do with Tsvangirai's wish for a Western-sponsored and organised election. Naturally, such an election is cast in very bad light way before it is even held. That is quite understandable when one looks at it from the view that says the US must lead all others. In fact, President Mugabe cannot call for a democratic election in Zimbabwe for as long as the West and the MDC-T are not ready for such a call. It is a matter of how ""democracy"" is defined in the Western lexicon. The Western propaganda model will always ensure that the favoured elections will legitimise the Western sponsored outcome, no matter what the facts are. The disfavoured election will always be found to be deficient, farcical, and always failing to legitimise - again, irrespective of the facts at hand. To this end a headline reading ""Mugabe wants an election in 2011"" is read to imply a dictatorship as reported by the likes of the BBC. If the headline read ""Tsvangirai wants an election in 2011"" then such a call would be viewed as not only legitimate but highly democratic -- regardless of the fact that it is Mugabe who is constitutionally mandated to call for elections in Zimbabwe, and not Tsvangirai, a mere Superintendent Minister in Robert Mugabe's Government. This is why Tsvangirai believes that his decision not to participate in elections is good enough to make an election illegitimate. He knows that regardless of the facts around that election, his Western backers will always discredit that election as illegitimate. He cherishes highly the prospect of another round of murderous illegal sanctions to push this cause. The Salvadoran and Guatemalan elections of 1982 and 1984/85 were held under conditions of severe, ongoing and systematic state terror against the civilian population, just like the 2009 Afghan elections. The Nicaragua 1984 election was a people driven popular process that had people expressing their will freely and independently. It was important for the Western media to find a standard by which they would legitimise the Salvadoran and Guatemalan elections while they made the Nicaraguan election a farce. The first step was to avoid discussing the Salvadoran and Guatemalan state terror and other basic electoral conditions in those elections. This is precisely why the numerous undemocratic and even criminal activities within the MDC-T are never reported in Western media. That is against the enhancement of the image of democracy that the West so wants to create through the pliant client party competing for political space in Zimbabwe. The Australian, a high level publication in Australia, was the only paper to pick up the story of the MDC-T appointed Ambassador Jacqueline Zwambila stripping in rage before three male staffers at the Zimbabwe Embassy in Canberra last week. The paper said ""we are baffled"" but pointed out that the more appropriate description for the act would have been that she ""disrobed to her undergarments"". The democracy propaganda model adopted by the West is based on a traditional election propaganda framework. The United States employs a number of devices in its sponsored elections so as to put them in favourable light. There are always issues that the US wants stressed and those other issues they want ignored or downplayed. About the rest of the West is just compliant to this tradition, if with little dramas from interesting countries like France and the Scandinavian region. The common strategy is the manipulation of symbols and agenda so as to create a positive image to a favoured election. Favoured elections are always associated with the happy word ""democracy"" and this is why that word is exclusively associated with the puppet MDC-T party in Zimbabwe. An election where the MDC-T does not participate, loses or complains cannot be democratic - regardless of the facts. This is besides the point that it is the MDC-T's democratic right not to take part in an election, if they so feel. It is seen as a form of moral triumph that Morgan Tsvangirai agrees to participate in an election, and this is why all Zimbabweans are supposed to put up with his politics of boycotts and flip flops. The man practices his folly within the propaganda framework of the West, and he pays no price for whatever manner of baseness he may portray, or so he believes. Tsvangirai calls for a people driven constitution and Zimbabwe produces one. The man realises that the produced constitution is a wild departure from the interests of his Western backers, and suddenly the whole process is labelled illegitimate and fraudulent. He even openly says he would overrule the people on this matter as soon his party gets a chance to rule the country -- regardless of the outcome of the referendum. Robert Mugabe says there will be an election in Zimbabwe because the legally agreed time for such an election is ripe and his call is vilified as undemocratic. Tsvangirai's kicking and screaming against such an election are hailed as the democratic voice. The only reason for this is Tsvangirai feels he is not ready for an election, basically because his party is in disarray by way of a dismantling political infrastructure and an overindulging team unabatedly enjoying power privileges in the inclusive Government. The newly appointed ministers in the inclusive Government will simply not allow an election to spoil their newly found luxurious lives, and even some from Zanu-PF are not too impressed with this prospect of a short-lived stint with luxury and privilege. The Benz boys won't let go easily. In 2006, the people of Gaza were torturously punished by the US-Israeli alliance for ""voting the wrong way"" in a free and fair election. This was a remarkable show of the people's will, and the long tortured and downtrodden people of Gaza chose to break out of the claws of the prison to which they had been confined by their US-backed captors from Israel. Gaza is regarded as the biggest prison on this planet and the world knows who runs it, and the timid support from Europe for this mega atrocity is probably the biggest shame in international relations today, apart from the lapdog support European countries give to Washington's military invasions. The Bush administration brutally responded to the democratic victory of Hamas in 2006, and some writers even blamed this administration for failing to recognise the incapacity of the unpeople of the Middle East to correctly appreciate democracy. The outcome was then viewed as a sign of the primitiveness and backwardness of the Palestinian people - not as a measure of the expression of their democratic will. If, or when the people of Zimbabwe will vote for Zanu- PF in 2011, they will equally be labelled backward and truly undemocratic -- all because there is no prospect for a democracy that produces a losing Tsvangirai in Zimbabwe; from a Western point of view. There are virtually no limits to the soaring rhetoric about the marvels of free and fair elections when they are believed to have come out ""the right way."" And equally there will always be soaring propaganda to discredit ""unfree and unfair elections"" when they are labelled as such because they are seen as having produced a ""wrong result"". Accordingly, the 2008 election in Lebanon was greeted with hyper euphoria in the West. New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman bragged that he is ""a sucker for free and fair elections,"" so ""it warms my heart to watch"" that what happened in the Lebanon election ""was indeed free and fair - not like the pretend election you are about to see in Iran, where only candidates approved by the Supreme Leader can run. ""No, in Lebanon it was the real deal, and the results were fascinating: President Barack Obama defeated President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran"". He added, ""a solid majority of all Lebanese-Muslims, Christians and Druse - voted for the March 14 coalition led by Saad Hariri, to the extent that anyone came out of this election with the moral authority to lead the next government, it was the coalition that wants Lebanon to be run by and for the Lebanese -- not for Iran, not for Syria and not for fighting Israel. Saad Hariri was standing for Barack Obama in this election, the very way Tsvangirai stands for Britain in any Zimbabwean election. The free election was credited to George W. Bush who stood up and pushed out the Syrians out of Lebanon in 2005, in order to create an environment of ""free and fair elections"". Says Friedman, ""Mr Bush helped create the space. Power matters. Mr Obama helped stir the hope. Words also matter."" The euphoria was joined by the likes of Elliot Abrams who wrote, ""The majority of Lebanese have rejected Hezbollah's claim that it is not a terrorist group but a 'national resistance' . . . The Lebanese had a chance to vote against Hezbollah, and took the opportunity"". The biggest problem with this euphoria is its incorrectness. It is never reported in the West that in reality, the Hezbollah-based March 8 coalition won handily, by approximately the same figure as Obama vs McCain in November 2008, about 53 percent of the popular vote, according to Lebanon's Ministry of Interior. It is like the widely reported view that the MDC-T of Zimbabwe defeated Zanu-PF by winning one seat ahead of the later, regardless of the MDC-trailing Zanu-PF by 3 percentage points in the popular vote. That popular vote is never reported in the West and when you mention it you are instantly labelled a propagandist for Zanu-PF. In reality ""the majority of Lebanese . . . took the opportunity"" to reject the charges that Friedman and Abrams repeat uncritically from Washington propaganda. Equally the majority of Zimbabweans endorsed Zanu-PF as the most popular party in the 2008 Parliamentary race and no amount of propaganda from the West can ever delete that reality. Friedman and Abrams were referring to representatives in Parliament, the very same way the MDC-T's lead was based by one parliamentary seat ahead of Zanu-PF, precisely their 100 seats compared to Zanu-PF's 99 at the time, now 100 after an independent rejoined the party. These are some of the weaknesses of the confessional voting systems, where seats granted to groups of people may be proportionally disadvantageous to other groups. In Zimbabwe it is the delimitation process that may award more seats to certain areas than to other areas of similar populations. In Lebanon's case it was the Shiites region disadvantaged by a system that sharply reduced the seats to some of the largest sects, where Hezbollah and its Amal ally had tremendous support. Any analyst worth the salt cannot miss such a glaring factor. But these are matters to be buried when one is looking at promoting Western democracy. Zimbabwe we are one and together we will overcome. It is homeland or death! The writer is a political writer."

Evatt, together with two other Labor heavyweights, Albert Monk of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and Frank Chamberlain, federal president of the Labor Party, made a joint statement opposing British and United States intervention in the Middle East. They said they wanted the human race to avoid becoming victims of a third world war, which would inevitably involve use of nuclear weapons. They said the policies of the prime minister, Robert Menzies, and foreign affairs minister, Richard Casey, supporting such involvement, were ""further evidence of the government's complete, blind allegiance"" to the foreign policies of both powers. Radio stations in Damascus, Cairo and Baghdad called on the people of Jordan to topple the pro-Western King Hussein and bring down his government. He was, according to Damascus radio, ""the British and Zionist puppet"". Hussein was accused of having sold out to the Americans. The 2000 British troops in Jordan were described as his ""palace guard"". The NSW secretary of the Department of Main Roads, R.F. Johnson, said the removal of tram tracks from the Sydney Harbour Bridge should be completed in late 1959.

220,Right Vision News,2010-11-24,USA: Remarks on the Release of the 2010 International Religious Freedom Report,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"November 24, 2010",,"Washington, Nov. 24 -- The U.S Department Of State has issued following Remarks: ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: Thank you, Madam Secretary, for your remarks and for your commitment to religious freedom and human rights generally. As Secretary Clinton has said, religious minorities in many societies today face serious restrictions on their ability to practice their faith, to congregate with others, to worship freely. In too many places, people are targeted because of their religious beliefs, and they face discrimination, intimidation, and even violent attacks. This year's report tells their stories. It relies on a universal standard, that contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These are human rights issues. It provides a baseline for understanding the global status of religious freedom around the world. It details both improvements we've seen over the past year as well as government failings. Let me give a few examples. In Iran, government respect for religious freedom continues to deteriorate, especially for groups like the Baha'i. In Burma, the government continues its tight control of the activities of Buddhist clergy and discriminates against minority religious communities. The release last Sunday of Aung San Suu Kyi is a positive step. However, there are more than 2,100 political prisoners in Burma, including many monks and other religious figures. In Pakistan, against the backdrop of continued extremist violence against civilian targets, the number and severity of reported cases against religious minorities increased. For example, in May, extremist attacks on two Ahmadi congregations in Lahore killed at least 86 people. In Uzbekistan, government respect for religious freedom declined in the last year in several areas. The government raided Christian and Baha'i services, and many members of minority religious groups face fines or other restrictions. The Government of Eritria continues to harass, arrest, and detain members of unapproved religious groups. Several hundred religious minority members are today in jail, in very harsh conditions. And in China, as the Secretary noted, we continue to see restrictions on the Uighur population in Xinjiang on the Tibetan Buddhist community, and other restrictions on religious freedom, including on the unauthorized house churches, Christian churches. There are some positive steps. President Obama, in his trip to Indonesia, noted that religious tolerance in that country is a defining and inspiring characteristic. The government has set up a national interfaith council. We participated earlier this year in a bilateral religious dialogue. In Syria and Turkey, the Grand Muftis have spoken out publically, urging tolerance towards Christians and Jews. In Spain, the government has appointed special prosecutors to focus on hate crimes. And in Brazil, an NGO commission on religious - commission against religious intolerance published a guide to combat racism and religious intolerance. And earlier this year, government in Rio created an office to combat religious intolerance. This morning Dr. Sujay Johnson Cook appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a step on her way to becoming, we hope, and are encouraging, the Ambassador-at-Large for Religious Freedom. I hope the confirmation process will go quickly, and she'll be able to join us to pursue this important agenda. I'm happy to take your questions. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: No. The report is a separate exercise from that, but we will be designating countries of particular concern in the next couple of months. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: Sure. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: Well, the commission, as you know, is an independent body. It has its own designations. This - we will make a judgment, as I say, in the next several months of the countries to be designated as countries of particular concern. We discuss Vietnam in the report. We have concerns about a range of things. In fact, I'll be going to Vietnam in December to renew a bilateral of human rights dialogue that we did last October, and these issues will certainly be prominent on the agenda. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: Well, as I said in my opening comment, these reports are a baseline, a factual baseline that is - that gives us information we need to then make policy. It is - the reports by themselves will never solve the problem. The reports, though, provide information, both for our diplomats but also for other governments, for the United Nations and others, to address these issues. We do raise these issues. I raise them in all of my travels and other senior U.S. officials do. And it's the combination of diplomatic pressure, public attention, and what happens within societies that makes a difference. One thing that's very striking to me about all of these reports is the extent to which those activists, religious leaders, in this case, appreciate the fact that their situation is being publicly identified. So there's a recognition on the part of those most affected that these issues - these reports give them strength, give them a sense of solidarity and support. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: We raise these issues everywhere and including in the countries you describe. As you know, for the Secretary, for me, for this Administration, the treatment of women and girls is an extremely important human rights issue. We raise it constantly, and this is part of that effort to be publicly identifying our support for their inclusion in every aspect of their societies. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: I can't speak about before. I can say that I'm discussing these issues constantly with our European allies. Let's take the minaret vote in Switzerland. The government didn't support that initiative. It was a public initiative. Fifty-some percent, I think 59 percent of the population voted to ban minarets. The Government of Switzerland, and I've talked to their representatives repeatedly, is now doing what it can to overturn that and to create a legal and a public process that will basically restore the ability of the Muslim community to build minarets. The same thing with the burqa ban. We raised that issue. Our own position, and again, President Obama spoke about this in the Cairo speech, we have gone to court in the United States to enforce the right of Muslim women and girls to wear a burqa on the streets, in schools, et cetera. That's our position. It's a position we articulate when we talk to our European friends. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: There is certainly a growing sensitivity and tension in Europe. And I think what we are urging, again, our European friends to do is to take every measure to try to alleviate that tension. These are - often in Europe and elsewhere, these are tensions between communities, and it's for the governments to be as proactive as it can in each of these situations to reduce the level of tension. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: We are - and have expressed great concern about the situation of the Christian community in Iraq. The bombing last month of the - Our Lady of Salvation Catholic Church, where more than 50 people were killed, was an example of the abhorrent violence that you describe. We've condemned that violence in the strongest terms. We have repeatedly spoken to government leaders in Iraq. And President Maliki has - I think now announced increased security for the Christian community, a rebuilding of that church. But we will continue to be vigilant, and this is an ongoing problem and challenge for all of the people of Iraq. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: Sure. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: I don't have anything to add on that community in particular. I think we're looking at the whole picture. And obviously, as Iraq creates a government, we're hoping that there can be a restoration of a better relationship and a more stable situation. A huge number of the Christian population have left the country, and so we are very mindful of the continuing tensions. And obviously, one aspect of that is to try to restore people who've lost homes and whose lives have been disturbed. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: I can't speak to the question of whether anybody's talked to President Sarkozy. I can say that I've talked to my counterparts in the French Government repeatedly about this. We have a difference of view. But I think our view is that for all of our allies, we're encouraging government actions to reduce, alleviate tensions, and to allow people to express their religious faith, including by the wearing of the burqa. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: I've been to Egypt twice in the last year, most recently last month in October. I've raised these issues with senior government officials. I was in Egypt first in January several weeks after the Nag Hammadi killings. We urged, and the government did initiate an investigation. There are now three people on trial. That's a step in the right direction. But I - my conversations - and I had a number of conversations with religious leaders, both Christian and Muslim, last month - the level of violence may not be increasing, but there's a great tension. There's a great sense that this sectarian tension is actually increasing. We'll continue to raise it. I raised it publicly there; I'll continue to raise it. These are concerns of ours, and they're certainly concerns to many, many people in Egypt. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: One of the things that President Obama has talked about - a principled engagement. We have a strong bilateral relationship with the Government of Egypt, we have many, many security and other interests which are very important. They've been a partner in the Middle East peace process. But these human rights issues are also front and center, and so we will continue to raise these issues, we'll continue to press them, and the sectarian tensions are an important piece of what we're discussing with them. MR. TONER: Yes, Michel. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: What do we consider them? ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: Well, right now, there are eight countries designated as countries of particular concern. Those eight countries are Burma, China, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Uzbekistan. As I said earlier, we are now reviewing that process separate from this report. This report states the facts. Now, we're going to have an internal process where we evaluate these, and in the next couple of months, we will designate countries going forward that are on this list. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: I can't speak to that. We haven't had the discussions, so we'll - as soon as we have the list, we'll let you see them. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: As you know, our relations with North Korea are strained, to say the least, and the - we raise publicly and in whatever ways we can a whole range of human rights concerns. The human rights situation in North Korea is desperate, and so on every measure, it is a country that's a consistent violator of human rights. We will continue to raise those issues publicly in whatever ways we can, try to encourage other governments to do the same. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: I'm sorry? ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: We have a special representative here in the State Department, Bob King, whose job is to pursue the human rights issues with respect to North Korea. And I think he's probably the person you ought to be talking to because he leads that effort. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: Well, we have had a range of concerns with Saudi Arabia in terms of restrictions on religious freedom. They've been on the list since 2004. The government bans any public religious observance outside of Islam. Even private religious observance is sometimes interfered with. We are concerned - continue to be concerned about educational materials. The government has made commitments to reform the textbooks and other educational materials. It has done some of that. But there still continue to be in the Saudi textbooks references - very negative, stereotypic references to Christians, Jews, and others, which we regard as offensive. So we have - these are real concerns. We obviously have a range of other interests as well with the Saudis, but this is part of human rights policy. We will continue to raise these concerns in particular with the Saudis as - until these issues are addressed. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: Now, I don't think I have much to add to what's in the report. I will say that we have with the Government of Laos signed an agreement which allows a U.S.-based NGO to provide training on religious freedom, both to government officials and religious leaders. It's often the case - Laos perhaps and elsewhere - that what the central government is doing is not completely in harmony with what goes on at a local level. So much, I guess, to the credit of the Government of Laos, they have been open to this kind of a training program and involvement by an NGO, and it's certainly something we're going to continue to work on. MR. TONER: There's time for a few more questions. Go ahead. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: Well, I think - again, I highlighted it as a - kind of an interesting example of a large Muslim country, but a pluralistic country where traditionally, different religions, different religious faiths, have coexisted. We applaud the fact that the government has set up a national interfaith council. As I say, we also, in January, undertook a bilateral dialogue where religious leaders, students, others came together from our two countries. So one of the things - again, I was in Indonesia earlier this year, and one of the things that's quite encouraging - as the President said, this is not a clean bill of health. There are obviously still a range of issues still to be addressed there. But there is a sense with the Indonesian Government that they're engaged in these issues from the president on down, and there is, I think, a potential for us - and we're eager to do it - to work with them not only with respect to Indonesia but with respect to with the region more broadly. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: You're talking about in Indonesia or -- ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: On Pakistan. We - there is, as you know, a widespread pattern of violent attacks from extremist groups. I mentioned the one, the bombing in May, but there have been attacks against Christians, against the Ahmadis. There's still discriminatory laws on the books, blasphemy laws, anti-Ahmadi laws. We are raising these issues with the Government of Pakistan. The government is taking steps. It's a very tense situation now and there are tensions within the society. So it's a mixed picture, honestly. We give the government credit for steps it's taken, but also recognize that more needs to be done and it's part of our diplomacy with them. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: Right. And as I said just a moment ago, we are mindful of those laws, we're concerned about those laws, we raise our concerns directly with the Government of Pakistan. One of the things this report does is identify in Pakistan and elsewhere government actions where - that contribute to the problem. And where we see that, we're going to raise it. Pakistan is not alone in that. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: Sure. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: I don't think a meeting ever gets results. There has to be a consistent message delivered by different people and it has to be accompanied by follow-up. That's what we're trying to do in each of these situations. We talked about Egypt. I've been there twice. I'm going to go back there. There are other government officials raising our concerns. Same think in Pakistan, the same thing in other countries I'm describing. In some places, we have more leverage than others. It's, frankly, difficult for us to exactly be the ones to promote a human rights agenda in North Korea because our relationship is so strained. But we will continue to raise these issues publicly and privately, and we regard this - again, the notion of principled engagement is this is part of what we do as a government. We're going to do it in a consistent way, in a sustained way. Multiple officials are going to raise it and we will keep pushing until we get the results that we're aiming for. The goal here is to allow people to practice their religion freely. This is a human rights issue and we regard it as one of great importance. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: Well, I think what I've said - and it has come up in several different contexts, with Egypt, with Saudi Arabia, with Pakistan - we apply a universal standard to every country, friends and countries that we have difficult relationships with. That doesn't mean we don't have security interests or economic interests or other diplomatic interests. But we will raise these issues as we see them. We'll call them as we see them. We'll write these reports straight out based on a universal standard. And we will continue to press governments to promote and respect religious freedom, the right of people to practice their religion freely without constraint. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: Yeah. Again, I'm going to take that question about the report. I have not seen that report. The designation of North Korea was made two years ago. We're reviewing it now. But from our perspective across the board, human rights are not respected, violated, in North Korea. And I'd be interested to see the report. I'm glad to give you a reaction. But we certainly see a very draconian government there that doesn't respect religious rites or human rights generally. ASSISTANT SECRETARY POSNER: I don't know about a legal act. We certainly are trying to encourage a greater international attention to these issues at the UN and elsewhere. Our decision to join the Human Rights Council last year was predicated on a belief that we could, by being engaged, raise these and other issues. So that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to - we, in September, for example, took the lead in a resolution on freedom of association. Part of that relates to religious communities. It's important that these religious communities, minority communities, don't feel isolated. And part of what we're also trying to do with this report and this effort is to make sure that religious groups that are feeling beleaguered and isolated understand that we're paying attention and we're helping them.

221,The New York Post,2010-11-10,BAM'S IRAN HEADACHE THROBS ANEW,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,All Editions; Pg. 11,"November 11, 2010",1186 words,"WITH the midterm election focused on jobs and the economy, President Obama had a holiday from foreign-policy headaches. Nothing says the holiday is over faster than a wake-up call about Iran's nuclear program. The call came from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who warned that, despite growing sanctions, there are zero signs the mad mullahs are backing off their quest for nukes. Netanyahu, in a speech to a Jewish group in New Orleans, didn't just offer a warning - he urged a potential solution. Calling the situation a paradox, he said the only hope for stopping Iran without force is for the United States and others ""to convince Iran that it is prepared to take such action."" ""Containment will not work,"" he added. ""It won't work with a brazen regime that accuses America of bombing its own cities on 9/11, openly calls for Israel's annihilation, and is the world's leading sponsor of terrorism."" The timing of the speech is almost as important as the content. Netanyahu has warned about Iran for more than a year, but never so aggressively in public. To protect his standing at home and his relationship with Obama, he swallowed humiliation and made concessions to Palestinians while sharing his worst fears about Iran in private. That strategy got him nowhere with Obama and congressional Democrats, but the election gives Israel new hope. Even though most American Jews vote Democratic, Republicans are now seen by many Israelis as a more reliable ally on combating Islamic terror. If nothing else, Israelis will want American backing for their own attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. The overall problem is that Obama's approach to the region has yielded the worst of both worlds. Iran has targeted Israel with new missiles, and its proxy armies of Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon are stockpiling weapons. Syria is moving closer to Iran, and Turkey is moving away from the West and Israel. Yet the deteriorating landscape has had little impact on Obama's open invitation to Iran for negotiations while squeezing Israel. He believed the creation of a Palestinian state would help him get the Arab world to back tough measures on Iran. The linkage approach is a dud. With each passing day, Iran is a day closer to a bomb, and the Palestinians have been tepid about direct talks with Israel. For its part, Israel has ended its moratorium on construction of new houses in disputed lands, and a new battle erupted yesterday over a plan for 1,300 units in east Jerusalem. Meanwhile, much of the Arab world openly fears an Iranian bomb more than it does Israel. Despite all that, the White House response to Netanyahu was more of the same, with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates saying, ""We continue to believe that the political-economic approach that we are taking is, in fact, having an impact on Iran."" That's a faith-based conclusion. By all factual measurements, Iran has expanded its terror franchises and grown bolder in the face of what it obviously regards as American weakness. Netanyahu summed up the Iranian menace this way: ""It denies the Holocaust. It sponsors terror. It confronts America in Afghanistan and Iraq. It dominates Lebanon and Gaza. It establishes beachheads in Arabia and in Africa. It even spreads its influence into this hemisphere, into South America."" It does all that without the bomb, he said. Imagine what it will do with the bomb. The sudden departure of a longtime key player in any organization is a shock, but Joel Klein's resignation yesterday takes the cake. Klein was the face of the city school system for eight years, and there was no indication he was ready to go. Indeed, he said recently he expected to stay through Mayor Bloomberg's third term, which ends Jan. 1, 2013. That was not to be, as the mayor praised Klein extensively while dropping the bombshell that Hearst magazine publisher Cathie Black replaces him. She manages 2,000 people and serves on several nonprofit boards, including a Harlem charter school, but has no experience in running schools. Klein becomes an executive vice president at News Corp, which owns The Post. Klein was never popular with parents, and the teachers union regarded him as Public Enemy No. 1. He and the mayor were also said to have an uneasy personal relationship, though education was clearly Bloomberg's top priority. He added billions of dollars to the budget, including giving raises of 43 percent to teachers. Still, not all was smooth sailing. Recent bad headlines ranged from falling test scores under new state standards to janitors being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars. Black thus inherits a system still looking for the sweet spot, and a mayor obviously eager for a faster pace of change. How scared are liberals about the rise of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie? Enough to try to hang him over $2,000. Yep, you read that right. A Justice Department report, breathlessly recounted by Politico and The New York Times, talks of a ""pattern of exceeding the government rate"" on hotel costs and ""insufficient, inaccurate or no justification"" for extra expenditures in his former job as federal prosecutor. Holy crime wave. Only in the fifth paragraph did the Times get around to saying the total amount in question was $2,176. Before you ask, the answer is no: They have no shame. It's not a fair fight. Sarah Palin is facing down Ben Bernanke, telling the brainy Federal Reserve boss to ""cease and desist"" in his plan to flood the financial system with $600 billion of freshly printed cash. If this were boxing, it would be stopped before Yappy Palin and Brainy Ben got into the ring. But hold on - there's a catch, a mighty big one. Germany, China, Russia, Brazil and Japan and most of the world's central banks are on Palin's side. They warn of a potential global disaster of rampant inflation and protectionism. They're also calling America a hypocrite because the cash surge will cheapen the dollar, a form of currency manipulation the United States finds abhorrent when China does it. The rising chorus of criticism is a ""global backlash"" against Bernanke, says The Wall Street Journal. Its editorial page concludes that Palin has effectively managed to put the case for a strong dollar ""back to the center of the American political debate,"" where it belongs, and adds: ""She shows a talent for putting a technical subject in language that average Americans can understand."" True story. Oh, what interesting times. The ACLU has a fool for a client. Even as it's in court trying to save the radical cleric's life, American-born Anwar al-Awlaki is urging Muslims to kill as many Americans as they can. ""All Americans are the enemy,"" says the man linked to several plots, including the failed Times Square bombing. The ACLU wants a judge to remove Awlaki from a CIA hit list because he's an American citizen. That gives new meaning to Catch-22. He uses his US ties to try to kill us, and we're supposed to spare him because of those ties. No, thanks."

Of these countries, by far the most interesting, and the most important, is Morocco. The Australian ambassador in faraway Paris is accredited to the Moroccan capital, Rabat. This is intensely sub-optimal, to put it mildly, in terms of Australia's national interests. I saw an example of this at first hand. An Australian delegation of six senior federal politicians, as well as business figures and a few journalists, just spent several days in Morocco. They met senior political leaders, government ministers, advisers to the King, businesspeople and regional officials. The Australian politicians were constantly interviewed by Moroccan television and newspapers. They had a higher media profile than any Australian group in Morocco in many years. Indeed, they were probably the largest delegation of their type ever to visit Morocco. Yet the Australian embassy in Paris involved itself in their visit not at all. It didn't brief the politicians, it didn't leverage their extraordinary access for its own purposes. Nothing at all was done to co-ordinate, or integrate, a coherent Australian approach. This, sadly, reflects the pathetically diminished status and resources of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Starved of resources for the life of the Howard government, DFAT has received no significant increase in resources under Labor. No other country of our size and wealth has such a paltry diplomatic representation. Morocco, with only a tiny fraction of our wealth, has much wider diplomatic representation than Australia.. This makes a complete mockery, by the way, of our claims to have anything of significance to say to the wider world about issues such as the Middle East peace process, nuclear non-proliferation or. more broadly, relations between Islam and the West. It is one of the many reasons we are likely to fail in our bid for a Security Council seat. It's fairly difficult to convince a country that you take its interests and views seriously if you can't even be bothered maintaining an embassy in its capital. This is a foolish mistake by Australia and reflects grossly flawed priorities. Our foreign aid budget is ballooning into the billions of dollars. Much of it, long after it's out of Australian hands, will inevitably be wasted in corruption, consultants and counterproductive policies. A portion of this money should be redirected to establishing new embassies and consulates. In itself, their establishment would contribute to the economies of the countries involved, many of which, like Morocco, we would like to help. But such embassies and consulates, by promoting trade and, even more significantly, by promoting wider political and human links with Australia, would also have much more diverse beneficial effects. If we were interested in doing the maximum amount to help and also optimising our influence and serving our interests most effectively, that's what we'd be doing. But so much of Australian foreign policy is posture, and posturing about the foreign aid budget is no exception. Similarly, a very bad dynamic has developed in Australian diplomacy during the past decade and a half. It's all about the personal appearances and media coverage of the prime minister and foreign minister, as though coherent foreign policy has no other expression. The absurd neglect of Morocco is a telling indictment of our national slackness in foreign policy, beyond our core traditional interests in North America, Asia and Europe (though even in these three areas there are huge gaps). Morocco is determinedly on the side of the friendship with the West, and on the side of moderation. It co-operates closely on security with the US and the European Union. Several years ago there were a very few terrorist bombings in Casablanca. Al-Qa'ida in the Maghreb has tried hard to infiltrate Morocco, but without great success. The government in Rabat is dealing with a desultory ethnic separatist movement in the Western Sahara, led by the Polisario Front, which is backed by Algeria and has links with al-Qa'ida. Morocco, unlike most of its neighbours, has no known reserves of oil, though it is highly prospective and Australian mining companies are interested in conducting exploration there. It survived the global financial crisis relatively well, with annual economic growth of about 4 per cent. But like most of the Arab world it has a high birthrate, a young population and a tremendous need for new jobs. Four per cent growth is not too bad, but Morocco needs a higher rate than that to absorb all the new entrants to the labour market each year. It is avowedly market-friendly and hungry for foreign investment. The big cities I visited, Casablanca and Rabat, are pretty clean and orderly, and though there are parts you certainly wouldn't visit after dark, I didn't feel any uneasiness on the street. Morocco is intensely proud that it didn't persecute its Jewish minority during World War II. It is proud that there is still a functioning and active Jewish Moroccan community. In all of this, if ever there were a state in North Africa that Australia ought to be developing an economic and political relationship with, it's Morocco. We can learn things from Morocco about the state of Islam in the Middle East and there are surely areas where our national genius, such as it is, could make a constructive contribution to Morocco's fortunes. But we are, on this as on most things, fast asleep, fat and happy on our mineral wealth, taking a holiday from our own reform, taking a holiday, it seems, from history itself. This is very dumb, both in the specifics of Morocco and more generally. For while we may not be interested in history, history, I fear, is very interested in us."
224,Right Vision News,2010-03-06,UAE: A power behind the presidents,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"March 11, 2010",,"Dubai, March 06 -- James Baker has never won elected office himself, but the Texas lawyer has long been a prominent player both in Washington and in international affairs, including as secretary of state. He has shown a particular interest in the Middle East. Patrick Granfield and Angela Shah writeAccording to our correspondent, James Baker III's pedigree invites certain comparisons, not all of them favourable. In the Middle East, any Texas Republican will find it hard to dissociate himself from others who have had such grand ambitions for the region, but with mixed results.James A Baker IIIBorn April 28, 1930 in Houston, Texas.Education Studied classics at Princeton University, graduating in 1952; completed his law degree at the University of Texas at Austin in 1957.Family His first wife Mary died in 1970. He is now married to Susan. He has eight children and 18 grandchildren.Mr Baker's drawl and down-home manner may bear a resemblance to the former US president George W Bush, but he doesn't walk with the same strut. Before Mr Baker was America's top diplomat, serving as secretary of state to the then president George HW Bush, he was well-practised in diplomacy. He tried to bridge the gap between two different cultures of Texas and Washington.He was never an ideological fire-brand or party loyalist. Mr Baker started out as a supporter of the Democratic Party. But his first wife, Mary McHenry, was an active Republican and a contributor to the congressional campaigns of George HW Bush.It was not until after her death from breast cancer in 1973 that Mr Baker became actively involved in politics.Mr Bush Sr, a longtime friend, asked him to run his campaign for the US Senate in Harris County, Texas. Mr Baker has said that Mr Bush asked for his help to ""give me something to do"" after his wife had died. Mr Baker ran for public office only once, for Texas attorney general in 1978. He lost.Mr Baker was in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday to announce the newest office of Baker Botts, his family's law firm based in Texas.For 20 minutes, Mr Baker offered opinions on topics ranging from the foreign policy approach of President Barack Obama during his first year in office, of which Mr Baker approved, to why he was ""very bullish"" on the UAE economy.Mr Baker even had some advice for the latest sporting gun slinger to come out of his alma mater, Colt McCoy, the quarterback at the University of Texas. McCoy is turning pro; the Washington Redskins are interested. ""He's got to cover his backside"", Mr Baker warns him about Washington, ""make sure he's got a good [offensive] line"".Few Texans have understood how the game is played in Washington as James Baker does. For his part, he's never preferred the role of a Quarterback or enjoyed the lime-light of calling the shots. For his part, Mr Baker has played more the role of left tackle, the position in American football that protects the quarterback's blind side.And although he turns 80 this year, it seems that if he got too close to gridiron today he would want to put on a helmet and pads. Mr Baker still appears to relish the dirty work in the trenches of international business and diplomacy.""Maybe he's got an overactive thyroid,"" suggests Lawrence Eagleburger, a former US secretary of state who served under Mr Baker when the latter was the top diplomat during the first Bush presidency. ""He likes to do the work.""Mr Baker was born into wealth but sloth was not an option. His father - dubbed the Warden by his children - was known to throw a bucket of ice water on his children if they weren't awake by 7am.Mr Baker studied classics at Princeton University but even as a student, politics and policy captured his attention. He wrote his senior thesis on the British Labour Party from 1945 to 1952.Taking one question after the next, he pauses only to complete a paragraph. The first question is about Iraqi oil, another about UN resolutions and the West Bank. He can also talk about American football with equal reflection. Sure, he's got his talking points, but he can't miss the opportunity to tell a good story.When pressed about the danger of the US negotiating with Syria, something he has long encouraged but appears increasingly futile, Mr Baker says diplomacy involves patience. And, it seems, some pain. He described his talks with the former Syrian president Hafaz Assad as ""bladder diplomacy"", with of ""a lot of tea and a lot of sweet juice"" during nine-hour negotiation sessions.""I'm a believer in meeting with your enemies as well as with your friends. You don't need to negotiate peace with your friends, you negotiate peace with your enemies.""Mr Baker is a serious diplomat but part of his power is his charm. As he says, ""diplomacy is best practised with a veiled fist"". He never did let a dictator or crisis get him all that worked up, and he saw a few during his 12 years serving two presidents.When the then president Ronald Reagan was shot outside the Washington Hilton in 1981, Mr Baker was the president's chief of staff. On the October day in 1987 when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 22 per cent, he was the secretary of the treasury. When the Berlin Wall came down two years later, Mr Baker was the secretary of state, the last one of the cold war.And in the summer of 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait, he was the official responsible for selling to the UN a resolution on the use of force against Iraq. He also built a team of 34 nations to enforce that resolution.""When I was putting together the coalition to kick Iraq out of Kuwait, China would not agree to the use of force,"" he recalls. ""And I worked on them and worked on them and worked on them, and finally got them to abstain."" Each of the remaining UN security council members voted in favour.The current secretary of state Hillary Clinton may have to confront similar difficulty with China again, this time to obtain sanctions against Iran to confront its suspected nuclear ambitions.Retired from serving the Oval Office in 1993, Mr Baker is a senior partner at Baker Botts. ""We like to say we have as many offices in the Middle East as we do in Texas because we have offices in Riyadh, Dubai and Abu Dhabi,"" he says.Certainly Mr Baker came from great privilege; if America has ever had something like an aristocracy, Mr Baker belonged to it. Reared in monied Houston society, he went to boarding school in Pennsylvania and has Ivy League credentials.Despite his accomplishments, there is a gap in Mr Baker's resume for a man of his accomplishments. He has never held elected office, never had to deliver stump speeches in the snow or plead for votes at a motorway dinner. He has managed two victorious presidential campaigns; it's not that he hasn't been to those events, just never as the main attraction.

226,Roll Call,2010-01-19,Chairman Kerry: Born for the Job; 1971 Testimony Heralded Future Role on Committee,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,COMMITTEE INSIDER,"January 19, 2010",1682 words,"There is something novelistic and poignant about Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) heading the Foreign Relations Committee. Kerry first burst into the public consciousness as a decorated 27-year-old Vietnam veteran, laying out his opposition to the war in spellbinding testimony before the committee on April 22, 1971. His haunting question, ""How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?"" is seared in the memories of many Americans - and remains controversial to this day. After listening to Kerry's remarks, then-Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), who would later spend eight years as Foreign Relations chairman, predicted that Kerry would someday become a member of the committee. It didn't take long for Pell to be proved right: Kerry was elected to the Senate in 1984 and was immediately assigned to the Foreign Relations panel. In its 194-year history, the committee has produced six presidents of the United States and 19 secretaries of State. In 2008, then-Chairman Joseph Biden (D-Del.) was elected vice president. Kerry has come close to being part of those elite groups but has fallen a little short. He almost won the White House in 2004. And it was widely assumed that he hungered to become secretary of State when President Barack Obama took office, only to see the job go to a Senate colleague, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Whatever political disappointments Kerry has endured, ""he's just decided he's going to live in the present. ... John Kerry, at heart, is a patriot,"" said Mary Beth Cahill, who was the Senator's campaign manager during his 2004 White House run. ""I learned a long time ago from a great teacher - Ted Kennedy - that you just have to put your head down and do the work and see where it leads,"" Kerry said in an e-mail to Roll Call. By all accounts, Kerry has jumped enthusiastically into his committee work since becoming chairman a year ago. He's committed to helping the young president and his administration but is mindful of the panel's constitutional duties and oversight powers. People who follow the committee closely say Kerry has brought a forward-looking approach to the job, buttressed by the kind of intellectual and political heft that is unique to a former presidential nominee with 40 years of involvement with foreign policy. ""He ran for president, he came very close to being president, so he brings more than the regular gravitas to the job. And he handles it very well,"" said Sen. Ted Kaufman (D-Del.), Biden's replacement in the Senate. In Kerry's first year as chairman, the committee held 125 hearings and recommended 127 Obama administration nominees to the full Senate. He also delivered 13 major foreign policy speeches and wrote two dozen opinion pieces on a broad range of topics that his committee has jurisdiction over. But more important than the quantity of the work product is the direction in which Kerry has tried to lead his committee. While remaining a steadfast ally to Obama, Clinton, Biden and the rest of the administration's foreign policy team, Kerry has sought to provide a road map of international challenges and opportunities for the U.S. Kerry spoke out quickly about the need to change U.S. policy in Afghanistan and sounded early warnings about the necessity to stabilize Pakistan as a key component of the war on terrorism. On Capitol Hill, he hosted a ""trilateral"" luncheon for Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and members of their respective cabinets. Kerry has worked to bolster the Middle East peace process and has warned administration officials about the destabilizing threats that Syria and Iran pose in the region. And as if the U.S. foreign policy to-do list weren't long enough, Kerry decided to make climate change a major part of his - and his committee's - agenda. ""He's really starting to use his talents and make it worthwhile,"" said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and Roll Call contributing writer. ""It's been a really strong year for him."" A Change in Status It has also been a year of transition for Kerry. Not only did he take over the gavel at Foreign Relations, relinquishing the one he held at the Small Business Committee, but he also, after 25 years in the Senate, became Massachusetts' senior Senator, following the August death of his legendary colleague, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D). Kennedy's death was traumatic for Kerry personally, as well as for Massachusetts voters and the state's political establishment. ""Kerry really thought that he never had a better friend in the world in 2004 than Ted Kennedy,"" Cahill recalled. ""And he really reciprocated in the final year of Sen. Kennedy's life ... and that was really something Sen. Kennedy was grateful for."" Phil Johnston, a Massachusetts Democratic insider who runs a public affairs firm in Boston, said Kerry ""has become an iconic figure in Massachusetts politics at this point"" after years in Kennedy's shadow and has taken on many of Kennedy's practical and symbolic responsibilities. It was also a busy year for Kerry on a personal level. The 66-year-old Senator had surgery in August to replace his right hip. Just two weeks ago, he had surgery to replace his left hip. Kerry wife's, Teresa Heinz Kerry, disclosed in December that she was being treated for breast cancer. And his younger daughter was married in October. A Job He Was Born for Through all the changes, holding the Foreign Relations gavel has, in some ways, kept Kerry focused and grounded. As the son of a foreign service officer, Kerry grew up all over the world and, ever since volunteering for the Navy during the Vietnam War, foreign policy has been his passion. Some critics such as Helle Dale, a senior fellow for public diplomacy at the Heritage Foundation, sneer that becoming chairman was a ""consolation prize"" for Kerry, after seeing Clinton nominated to be secretary of State. But if Kerry was disappointed, he never showed it - and one of his first acts as chairman was to preside over Clinton's confirmation hearings. Kerry has been a solid partner for the Obama administration ever since, jumping into political hot spots around the world at a moment's notice. He traveled to Afghanistan in October, for example, to meet with Afghan leaders in the midst of the country's questionable election process. In an e-mail to Roll Call, Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, said ""Kerry's presence and role were really decisive"" in ensuring that the election was carried out to the satisfaction of world leaders. ""His impressive diplomatic skills, knowledge of the region, relationships and credibility with President Karzai and key Afghan leaders, and sheer determination were all instrumental in achieving a good outcome,"" Eikenberry said. Dale, the Heritage Foundation scholar, said the Foreign Relations Committee has become too closely linked with the Obama administration since Kerry became chairman. While politics dictates that a chairman who comes from the same party as the president is going to largely be supportive, Dale said that Kerry spends more time criticizing the previous Republican administration than the current one and isn't holding Obama accountable for failing to meet certain deadlines for progress reports and policy updates. ""I think there are opportunities for oversight that should be taken advantage of,"" she said. Kerry said the ability to work with Obama gives Democrats ""a wonderful moment ... to get some big things done."" ""This is a moment I've been waiting for, to have a president of my party, to have a vice president who has been my friend for 25 years, and finally to have working majorities in Congress,"" he said. Kerry is also boldly playing a role in another key Obama initiative that doesn't fall naturally into his committee's portfolio: climate change. Not only did Kerry co-sponsor the Senate's principal cap-and-trade bill with Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), the Environment and Public Works chairman, but he has run the legislation through the Foreign Relations Committee - even though the primary markup will take place in EPW. Kerry is also leading ""tripartisan"" talks on the issue with Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Joe Lieberman (ID-Conn.). Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservative Voters, said that by putting the measure in front of Foreign Relations, Kerry has illustrated that climate change is truly a global issue, not just a question of modernizing U.S. environmental law. ""It sort of in essence doubles down his ability to be effective,"" Karpinski said. Beyond policy questions, Kaufman said that Kerry has proved to be a very good manager of the Foreign Relations Committee at the most basic level. He deploys his staff well, he delegates responsibility, he's courteous to junior members and he isn't turf conscious. ""It's a real working committee, and I think Kerry deserves a lot of credit for that,"" Kaufman said. The Days Ahead Looking ahead, Kerry said that the Foreign Relations Committee ""will continue to ask the tough questions"" on a variety of issues. He has already invited the father of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the man accused of trying to blow up a Northwest Airlines plane on Christmas Day, to testify before the committee this week. On the political front, like a lot of top-ranking Democrats, Kerry has spent the last few days trying to help Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley (D) win today's special election to replace Kennedy - a race that has been a lot more difficult than party leaders bargained for. Kerry penned a fundraising appeal for Coakley on behalf of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee last week, and as of press time was expected to make at least one appearance with Coakley over the weekend - his first public event since his hip replacement surgery earlier this month. Cahill, his former campaign manager, said one of Kerry's most prized possessions is a picture of him and Kennedy together on the Capitol steps, taken on Kerry's first day in office. ""He's determined to make sure that he and Martha Coakley can take the same picture together,"" Cahill said."
227,Guardian.com,2010-07-14,Iran could spring a nasty surprise,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"July 14, 2010",996 words,"Simon Tisdall: It wouldn't take much for the row over nuclear weapons between Iran, the US and Israel to spark a full-blown crisis Barack Obama expressed confidence last week that Israel would not attack Iran without first consulting him. ""It is unacceptable for Iran to possess nuclear weapons and we are going to do everything we can to prevent that happening,"" . ""I think the relationship between the US and Israel is sufficiently strong that neither of us try to surprise each other."" But Obama left a lot unsaid. He did not say he would oppose or try to block future Israeli air strikes on Iran's nuclear plants - only that he expected to hear about them in advance. And he did not say Washington would refuse to assist or participate, directly or indirectly, in any such attack. The US preferred a diplomatic solution, he said. But then came the familiar mantra: ""I assure you I have not taken options off the table."" Conversely, nothing Obama said can remove the possibility that dangerous surprises may be in store, for both Israel and the US, emanating from Iran. The depth and breadth of the confrontation with Tehran on numerous fronts - political, commercial, geographical and physical - is growing exponentially. The situation grows less predictable, and thus more volatile, by the day. It would not take much to spark a full-blown crisis, most probably unplanned. Like an angry, defiant boxer who is bloodied but unbeaten, the Iranian regime is starting to hit out in all directions. After the UN, US and EU , a scornful President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Iran's nuclear programme . ""Those resolutions are only paper. What's going to shape our future is our determination."" Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the caustically anti-western chairman of the Iranian parliament's foreign affairs committee, this week turned his fire on Russia, Tehran's long-time nuclear collaborator, for backing sanctions. ""A powerful country like Russia should not be manipulated by American and British intelligence services,"" . Iran is ever more sharply at odds with its Gulf neighbours, who in turn are giving public voice to longstanding fears about Persian power. Recent remarks attributed to the UAE's ambassador to the US, to the effect that his country ""cannot live with a nuclear Iran"", fed existing tensions over disputed territory and energy resources and Shia Iran's alleged subversion of the Sunni-led monarchies. According to the conservative American commentator, , a former Arab leader in close touch with regional governments ""all the Middle Eastern and Gulf leaders now want Iran taken out of the nuclear arms business, and they all know sanctions won't work"". What they, like Israel, increasingly complain about, however, is the weakness of American leadership. The list of flashpoints that could produce nasty surprises just keeps growing. US commanders in Iraq warned this week that a militant Shia group, Kataib Hezbollah, allegedly financed and trained by Iran's Revolutionary Guards, has sent fighters into Iraq to launch attacks coinciding with imminent US troop withdrawals. In Afghanistan, coalition forces continue to find evidence of Iranian support for the Taliban and al-Qaida-linked warlord militias. In increasingly fractious south Lebanon, according to Israel at least, Hezbollah is arming itself for a new war, aided and abetted by Syria, which is supposedly smuggling advanced missiles from Iran. Israeli army spokesmen told Haaretz newspaper that Hezbollah now has 40,000 short- and medium-range rockets and 20,000 fighters. ""Southern Lebanon, despite the good work of the UN, has been hijacked by terrorism, by Hezbollah,"" said Israeli diplomat Daniel Carmon. Another conflagration constantly threatens, meanwhile, on Israel's southern flank where the ongoing controversy over international humanitarian aid convoys to Gaza is bolstering Hamas's opposition to US-backed peace talks. The decision by a to divert to Egypt does not mark an end of the affair. More blockade-busting ships are promised, not least by Iran. The possibility the Tehran regime may spring a surprise or two of its own against its Israeli and American antagonists is heightened by growing domestic economic unrest over VAT increases and proposed cuts in energy and food subsidies. Oil income is down and whatever Tehran says, the sanctions are biting. Crucially, BP, Shell and Total have been joined by Russia's Lukoil, Malaysia's Petronas and others in restricting or halting sales of refined oil products including petrol. Given this increasingly unstable context, a new report by the independent Oxford Research Group concludes that the prospect of hostilities between Iran and Israel, potentially drawing in the US, has ""grown sharply"". The consequences would be devastating for the region and beyond, it says, while the fighting would not be limited to air strikes but would most probably escalate into a protracted war over an extended area. Israeli officials say the US and its partners have, at most, two years to resolve the Iranian nuclear problem before military action becomes unavoidable. Others say there is even less time. ""Current trends suggest Iran could achieve nuclear weapons capability before the end of this year, posing a strategically untenable threat to the US ... We do not believe a nuclear weapons-capable Iran could be contained,"" said the former Democrat senator Charles Robb and retired US general Charles Wald in a recent policy paper. ""The [Obama] administration needs to ... make clear to the Iranian regime and the American people: if diplomatic and economic pressures do not compel Iran to terminate its nuclear programme, the US military has the capability and is prepared to launch an effective, targeted strike on Tehran's nuclear and supporting military facilities."""
228,Guardian.com,2010-09-22,This dangerous new world of self-interested nations,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"September 22, 2010",912 words,"Simon Tisdall: From Kashmir to Kurdistan, a non-interventionist stance from the major powers is of no help to the world's trouble spots In diplomatic parlance, the term ""frozen conflict"" generally refers to unresolved disputes affecting countries of the . But in the post-ideological, non-interventionist age that dawned with the fall of George Bush and Tony Blair and the rise of new, ruthlessly pragmatic, self-interested great powers such as China and India, a widening range of intractable conflicts, from Somalia, Kashmir and Kurdistan to Kyrgyzstan, Burma and Tibet might fairly be described as frozen, too. In many if not most of such cases, external conflict-resolution efforts are underpowered, stalled, failing, or nonexistent. The appeals of pressure groups, thinktanks and activists increasingly fall on deaf ears. The US and its junior partner, Britain, no longer actively seek to spread freedom and democracy across the globe. Instead, Washington has ""reset"" relations with authoritarian Russia, sought a strategic accommodation with communist China, moved to cut its losses in still shambolic Iraq and Afghanistan, and is aggressively arming Middle East autocrats. What George Bush Sr called the ""vision thing"", exemplified by his bid to build a post-Soviet, post-cold war ""new world order"", is almost wholly lacking now. Today's more blinkered emphasis is on trade, oil and security, not self-determination or human rights. Diplomacy, in its highest form of independent, impartial mediation, is out of fashion. Only the current American-led peace efforts in Israel-Palestine contradict the overall trend. Even there, Barack Obama was obliged to justify his intervention by redefining the conflict as a threat to US national interests. The UN, ever a convenient scapegoat, is blamed more often than not for failures in tackling outrages such as the murderous treatment of or . But, as always, it is the member states, and particularly the security council's veto-wielding permanent five, that carry prime responsibility for collective action or, more commonly, inaction. Thus, for example, the major powers have put expediency before principle in tacitly agreeing not to pursue Sudan's indicted president, , for alleged war crimes, at least until the looming issue of southern Sudan's secession is settled. Likewise, the Darfur peace talks are on the backburner. Muhammad Farooq Rehmani, chairman of the Jammu and People's Freedom League and former convenor of the opposition coalition, bears eloquent witness to the invidious consequences of such neglect. A journalist, author and political activist, he has spent nearly 10 years in jail, on and off, since first being arrested by Indian security forces in 1968. Kashmiris want the withdrawal of the Indian army and a plebiscite on self-determination, as promised repeatedly by the UN since 1947, he said. They are still waiting. ""If the killing of innocents continues, the violence could get worse,"" Rehmani, who lives in exile in Islamabad, said in London this week. This summer's clashes, curfews and security crackdowns in the state capital Srinagar and elsewhere might only be termed an ""uprising"" that could be exploited by Islamist jihadis. Yet powers such as the US and Britain were reluctant to pressure a newly important India for a deal, he said. There was no peace process, no peace, and no prospect of it. Sadly, Kashmir's plight is unexceptional. Attempts by Turkey's to win greater autonomy have stalled in the past year, mirroring the bigger problems facing an unrecognised Kurdish nation straddling Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. But there is zero international appetite for tackling the Kurdish question. Despite years of western hand-wringing over terrorism, piracy and immigration, Somalia remains a de facto no-go area for international diplomacy; likewise long-suffering Zimbabwe; likewise Thailand's disadvantaged southern Malay minority; the much put-upon ; and the . Even where the international community has stepped in, lack of leadership, selfish calculation, and a craven reluctance to make a stand increasingly characterise much of what is happening now. remain under Russian occupation, despite the French-brokered 2008 deal for a troop withdrawal; Burma's criminal generals carry on regardless of international sanctions; and even Kosovo, that great test-bed of liberal humanitarian interventionism, is still too weak and divided to leave to its own devices, more than 10 years after its ""liberation"". It may be this apparent diplomatic drift, this reluctance of individual governments and collectives such as the EU to risk new international entanglements or enforce existing rules and standards, comes in reaction to the ideologically driven excesses of the Bush years. Perhaps it is linked to the economic downturn in the west, with falling business confidence matched by falling diplomatic and political confidence. But perhaps, more than anything, it is the product of a new, narrow, self-serving national self-interestedness - a sort of Tea Party philosophy writ large in which charity begins at home, the weak go to the wall, and the devil take the hindmost. Whatever the reason, it's all very short-sighted, and dangerous, too."
229,Australian Financial Review,2010-04-09,Beware the Jimmy Carter syndrome,First Edition,,Transcript,,KONRAD YAKABUSKI,ENGLISH,BOOK REVIEW; MEMOIR; Pg. F9,"September 23, 2010",699 words,"Walter Russell Mead reveals the contradictions emerging in Barack Obama's approach to foreign policy Neither a cold-blooded realist nor a bleeding-heart idealist, Barack Obama has a split personality when it comes to foreign policy. So did most United States presidents, of course, and the ideas that inspire this one have a long history at the core of the American political tradition. In the past, such ideas have served the country well. But the conflicting impulses influencing how this young leader thinks about the world threaten to tear his presidency apart - and, in the worst scenario, turn him into a new Jimmy Carter. Obama's long deliberation over the war in Afghanistan is a case study in presidential schizophrenia: After 94days of internal discussion and debate, he ended up splitting the difference - rushing in more troops as his generals wanted, while calling for their departure to begin in July2011 as his liberal base demanded. It was a sober compromise that suggests a man struggling to reconcile his worldview with the weight of inherited problems. Like many of his predecessors, Obama is not only buffeted by strong political headwinds, but also pulled in opposing directions by two of the major schools of thought that have guided American foreign-policy debates since colonial times. In general, US presidents see the world through the eyes of four giants: Alexander Hamilton, Woodrow Wilson, Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. Hamiltonians share the first treasury secretary's belief that a strong national government and a strong military should pursue a realist global policy and that the government can and should promote economic development and the interests of American business at home and abroad. Wilsonians agree with Hamiltonians on the need for a global foreign policy, but see the promotion of democracy and human rights as the core elements of American grand strategy. Jeffersonians dissent from this globalist consensus; they want the US to minimise its commitments and, as much as possible, dismantle the national-security state. Jacksonians are today's Fox News watchers. They are populists suspicious of Hamiltonian business links, Wilsonian do-gooding and Jeffersonian weakness. Moderate Republicans tend to be Hamiltonians. Move right towards the Sarah Palin range of the party and the Jacksonian influence grows. Centrist Democrats tend to be interventionist-minded Wilsonians, while on the left and the dovish side they are increasingly Jeffersonian, more interested in improving American democracy at home than exporting it abroad. Some presidents build coalitions; others stay close to one favourite school. As the Cold War ended, George HWBush's administration steered a largely Hamiltonian course, and many of those Hamiltonians later dissented from his son's war in Iraq. Bill Clinton's administration in the 1990s mixed Hamiltonian and Wilsonian tendencies. This dichotomy resulted in bitter administration infighting when those ideologies came into conflict - over humanitarian interventions in the Balkans and Rwanda, for example, and again over the relative weight to be given to human rights and trade in US relations with China. More recently, George WBush's presidency was defined by an effort to bring Jacksonians and Wilsonians into a coalition; the political failure of Bush's ambitious approach created the context that made the Obama presidency possible. September 11, 2001, was one of those rare and electrifying moments that waken Jacksonian America and focus its attention on the international arena. The US homeland was not only under attack, it was under attack by an international conspiracy of terrorists who engaged in what Jacksonians consider dishonourable warfare: targeting civilians. Jacksonian attitudes towards war were shaped by generations of conflict with Native American peoples across the US and before that by centuries of border conflict in England, Scotland and Ireland. Against ""honourable enemies"" who observe the laws of war, one is obliged to fight fair; those who disregard the rules must be hunted down and killed, regardless of technical niceties. When the US is attacked, Jacksonians demand action; they leave strategy to the national leadership. But Bush's tough-minded Jacksonian response to September11 - invading Afghanistan and toppling the Taliban government that gave safe haven to the plotters - gave way to what appeared to be Wilsonian meddling in Iraq. Originally, Bush's argument for overthrowing Saddam Hussein rested on two charges that resonated powerfully with Jacksonians: Hussein was building weapons of mass destruction, and he had close links with al-Qaeda. But the war dragged on, and as Hussein's fabled hoards of weapons of mass destruction failed to appear and the links between Iraq and al-Qaeda failed to emerge, Bush shifted to a Wilsonian rationale. This was no longer a war of defence against a pending threat or a war of retaliation; it was a war to establish democracy, first in Iraq and then throughout the region. Nation-building and democracy-spreading became the cornerstones of the administration's Middle East policy. Bush could not have developed a strategy better calculated to dissolve his political support at home. Jacksonians historically have little sympathy for expensive and risky democracy-promoting ventures abroad. They generally opposed the humanitarian interventions in Somalia, Bosnia and Haiti during the Clinton years; they did not and do not think American young people should die and American treasure should be scattered to spread democracy or protect human rights overseas. Paradoxically, Jacksonians also opposed ""cut and run"" options to end the war in Iraq even as they lost faith in both Bush and the Republican Party; they don't like wars for democracy, but they also don't want to see the US lose once troops and the national honour have been committed. In Bush's last year in office, a standoff ensued: The Democratic congressional majorities were powerless to force change in his Iraq strategy and Bush remained free to increase US troop levels, yet the war itself and Bush's rationale for it remained deeply unpopular. Enter Obama. An early and consistent opponent of the Iraq war, Obama was able to bring together the elements of the Democratic Party's foreign-policy base who were most profoundly opposed to (and horrified by) Bush's policy. Obama made opposition to the Iraq war a centrepiece of his eloquent campaign, drawing on arguments that echoed US anti-war movements all the way back to Henry David Thoreau's opposition to the Mexican-American War. Like Carter in the 1970s, Obama comes from the old-fashioned Jeffersonian wing of the Democratic Party, and the strategic goal of his foreign policy is to reduce America's costs and risks overseas by limiting US commitments wherever possible. He's a believer in the notion that the US can best spread democracy and support peace by becoming an example of democracy at home and moderation abroad. More than this, Jeffersonians such as Obama think oversize commitments abroad undermine American democracy at home. Large military budgets divert resources from pressing domestic needs; close association with corrupt and tyrannical foreign regimes involves the US in dirty and cynical alliances; the swelling national-security state threatens civil liberties and leads to powerful pro-war, pro-engagement lobbies among corporations nourished on grossly swollen federal defence budgets. While Bush argued that the only possible response to the September11 attacks was to deepen America's military and political commitments in the Middle East, Obama initially sought to enhance America's security by reducing those commitments and toning down aspects of US Middle East policy, such as support for Israel, that foment hostility and suspicion in the region. He seeks to pull US power back from the borderlands of Russia, reducing the risk of conflict with Moscow. In Latin America, he has so far behaved with scrupulous caution and, clearly, is hoping to normalise relations with Cuba while avoiding collisions with the ""Bolivarian"" states of Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia. Obama seeks a quiet world in order to focus his efforts on domestic reform - and to create conditions that would allow him to dismantle some of the national-security state inherited from the Cold War and given new life and vigour after September11. Preferring disarmament agreements to military build-ups and hoping to substitute regional balance-of-power arrangements for massive unilateral US force commitments all over the globe, the President wishes ultimately for an orderly world in which burdens are shared and the military power of the US is a less prominent feature on the international scene. While Wilsonians believe that no lasting stability is possible in a world filled with dictatorships, Jeffersonians like Obama argue that even bad regimes can be orderly international citizens if the incentives are properly aligned. Syria and Iran don't need to become democratic states for the US to reach long-term, mutually beneficial arrangements with them. And it is North Korea's policies, not the character of its regime, that pose a threat to the Pacific region. At this strategic level, Obama's foreign policy looks a little bit like that of Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger. In Afghanistan and Iraq, he hopes to extract US forces from costly wars by the contemporary equivalent of the Vietnamisation policy of the Nixon years. He looks to achieve an opening with Iran comparable to Nixon's rapprochement with communist China. Just as Nixon established a constructive relationship with China despite the radical Red Guard domestic policies Chinese leader Mao Zedong was pursuing at the time, Obama does not see ideological conflict as necessarily leading to poor strategic relations between the US and the Islamic Republic. Just as Nixon and Kissinger sought to divert international attention from their retreat in Indochina by razzle-dazzle global diplomacy that placed Washington at the centre of world politics even as it reduced its force posture, so too the Obama administration hopes to use the President's global popularity to cover a strategic withdrawal from the exposed position in the Middle East that it inherited from the Bush administration. This is both an ambitious and an attractive vision. Success would reduce the level of international tension even as the US scales back its commitments. The US would remain, by far, the dominant military power in the world, but it would sustain this role with significantly fewer demands on its resources and less danger of war. Yet as Obama is already discovering, any president attempting such a Jeffersonian grand strategy in the 21st century faces many challenges. In the 19th-century heyday of Jeffersonian foreign policy in American politics, it was easier for US presidents to limit the country's commitments. Britain played a global role similar to that of the US today, providing a stable security environment and promoting international trade and investment. Cruising as a free rider in the British world system allowed Americans to reap the benefits of Britain's world order without paying its costs. As British power waned in the 20th century, Americans faced starker choices. With the British Empire no longer able to provide political and economic security worldwide, the US had to choose between replacing Britain as the linchpin of world order with all the headaches that entailed or going about its business in a disorderly world. In the 1920s and 1930s, Americans gave this latter course a try; the rapid-fire series of catastrophes - the Great Depression, World War II, Stalin's bid for Eurasian hegemony - convinced virtually all policymakers that the first course, risky and expensive as it proved, was the lesser of the two evils. Indeed, during Franklin Roosevelt's first two terms, the US pursued essentially Jeffersonian policies in Europe and Asia, avoiding confrontations with Germany and Japan. The result was the bloodiest war in world history, not a stable condominium of satisfied powers. Since that time, Jeffersonians have had to come to terms with the vast set of interlocking political, economic and military commitments that bind the US to its role in the postwar era. Jeffersonian instincts call for pruning these commitments back, but it is not always easy to know where to cut. The other schools are generally sceptical about reducing American commitments. Wilsonians interpret Jeffersonian restraint as moral cowardice. Why, they ask, did Obama refuse to meet the sainted Dalai Lama on his way to kowtow to the dictators in Beijing? Jacksonians think it is cowardice pure and simple. And why not stand up to Iran? Hamiltonians may agree with Jeffersonian restraint in particular cases - they don't want to occupy Darfur either - but sooner or later they attack Jeffersonians for failing to develop and project sufficient American power in a dangerous world. Moreover, Hamiltonians generally favour free trade and a strong dollar policy; in current circumstances Hamiltonians are also pushing fiscal restraint. Obama will not willingly move far or fast enough to keep them happy. The widespread criticism of Obama's extended Afghanistan deliberations is a case in point. To a Jeffersonian president, war is a grave matter and such an undesirable course that it should only be entered into with the greatest deliberation and caution; war is truly a last resort, and the costs of rash commitments are more troubling than the costs of debate and delay. Hamiltonians would be more concerned with executing the decision swiftly and with hiding from other powers any impression of division among American counsels. But Obama found harsh critics on all sides: Wilsonians recoiled from the evident willingness of the President to abandon human rights or political objectives to settle the war. Jacksonians did not understand what, other than cowardice or dithering, could account for his reluctance to support the professional military recommendation. And the most purist of the Jeffersonians - neoisolationists on both left and right - turned on Obama as a sellout. Jeffersonian foreign policy is no bed of roses. In recent history, Jeffersonian foreign policy has often faced attacks from all the other schools of thought. Kissinger's policy of detente was blasted on the right by conservative Republicans who wanted a stronger stand against communism and on the left by human rights Democrats who hated the cynical regional alliances the Nixon Doctrine involved (with the shah of Iran, for example). Carter faced many of the same problems, and the image of weakness and indecision that helped doom his 1980 run for re-election is a perennial problem for Jeffersonian presidents. Obama will have to leap over these hurdles now, too. It is not only Americans who will challenge the new American foreign policy. Will Russia and Iran respond to Obama's conciliatory approach with reciprocal concessions - or, emboldened by what they interpret as American weakness and faltering willpower, will they keep pushing forward? Will the President's outreach to the moderate majority of Muslims around the world open an era of better understanding, or will the violent minority launch new attacks that undercut the President's standing at home? Will the President's inability to deliver all the Israeli concessions Arabs would like erode his credibility and contribute to even deeper levels of cynicism and alienation across the Middle East? Can the President execute an orderly reduction in the US military stake in Iraq and Afghanistan without having hostile forces fill the power vacuum? Will Venezuelan leader Hugo ChÃ¡vez be so impressed with American restraint under Obama that he moderates his own course and ceases to make anti Yanquismo a pillar of his domestic and international policy? Will other countries heed the President's call to assume more international responsibility as the US reduces its commitments - or will they fail to fulfill their obligations as stakeholders in the international system? A Jeffersonian policy of restraint and withdrawal requires co-operation from many other countries, but the prospect of a lower American profile may make others less, rather than more, willing to help the US. There is an additional political problem for this President, one that he shares with Carter. In both cases, their basic Jeffersonian approach was balanced in part by a strong attraction to idealistic Wilsonian values and their position at the head of a Democratic Party with a distinct Wilsonian streak. A pure Jeffersonian wants to conserve the shining exceptionalism of the American democratic experience and believes that American values are rooted in US history and culture and are therefore not easily exportable. For this President, that is too narrow a view. Like Abraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson and Martin Luther King jnr, Barack Obama doesn't just love the US for what it is. He loves what it should - and can - be. Leadership is not the art of preserving a largely achieved democratic project; governing is the art of pushing the US farther down the road towards the still-distant goal of fulfilling its mission and destiny. Obama may well believe what he said in his inaugural speech - ""we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals"" - but as any president must he is already making exactly those tradeoffs. Why else refuse to meet the Dalai Lama? Why else pledge support to the corrupt regime of President Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan or aid Pakistan despite the dismal track record of both the civil and military arms of the Pakistani government when it comes to transparent use of US resources? Did the administration not renew its efforts to build a relationship with the regime in Tehran even as peaceful democratic protesters were being tortured and raped in its jails? Is Obama not taking incentives to Khartoum, a regime that has for more than a decade pursued a policy in Darfur that the US government has labelled genocidal? It is hard to reconcile the transcendent Wilsonian vision of America's future with a foreign policy based on dirty compromises with nasty regimes. If the government should use its power and resources to help the poor and the victims of injustice at home, shouldn't it do something when people overseas face extreme injustice and extreme peril? The Obama administration cannot easily abandon a human rights agenda abroad. The contradiction between the sober and limited realism of the Jeffersonian worldview and the expansive, transformative Wilsonian agenda is likely to haunt this administration as it haunted Carter's, most fatefully when he rejected calls to let the shah of Iran launch a brutal crackdown to remain in power. Already the Wilsonians in Obama's camp are muttering darkly about his failure to swiftly close the Guantanamo prison camp, his fondness for government secrecy, his halfhearted support for investigating abuses of the past administration, and his failure to push harder for a cap-and-trade bill before the Copenhagen summit. Over time, these rumblings of discontent will grow, and history will continue to throw curveballs at him. Can this President live with himself if he fails to prevent a new round of genocide in the Great Lakes region of Africa? Can he wage humanitarian war if all else fails? Can he make these tough decisions quickly and confidently when his closest advisers and his political base are deeply and hopelessly at odds? The Jeffersonian concern with managing America's foreign policy at the lowest possible level of risk has in the past helped presidents develop effective grand strategies, such as George Kennan's early Cold War idea of containment and the early 19th century Monroe Doctrine. If successful, Obama's restructuring of American foreign policy would be as influential as these classic strategic designs. Recent decades, however, have seen diminishing Jeffersonian influence in US foreign policy. Americans today perceive problems all over the world; the Jeffersonian response often strikes people as too passive. Kennan's modest form of containment quickly lost ground to Dean Acheson's more muscular and militarised approach of responding to Soviet pressure by building up US and allied forces in Europe and Asia. The Nixon-Kissinger policy of detente was repudiated by both the Republican and Democratic parties. Carter came into the White House hoping to end the Cold War, but by the end of his tenure he was supporting the resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, increasing the defence budget and laying the groundwork for an expanded US presence in the Middle East. In the 21st century, American presidents have a new set of questions to consider. The nature of the international system and the place of the US in it will have to be rethought as new powers rise, old ones continue to fade, and attention shifts from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The rapid technological development that is the hallmark of our era will reshape global society at a pace that challenges the ability of every country in the world to manage cascading, accelerating change. With great dignity and courage, Obama has embarked on a difficult and uncertain journey. The odds, I fear, are not in his favour, and it is not yet clear that his intuitions and instincts amount to the kind of grand design that statesmen such as John Quincy Adams and Henry Kissinger produced in the past. But there can be no doubt that American foreign policy requires major rethinking. At their best, Jeffersonians provide a necessary element of caution and restraint in US foreign policy, preventing what historian Paul Kennedy calls ""imperial overstretch"" by ensuring that America's ends are proportionate to its means. We need this vision today more than ever: If Obama's foreign policy collapses - whether sunk by Afghanistan or conflicts not yet foreseen - into the incoherence and reversals that ultimately marked Carter's well-meaning but flawed approach, it will be even more difficult for future presidents to chart a prudent and cautious course through the rough seas ahead.

The appointment of Frank Iacobucci announced yesterday to review documents from the Afghan detainees dispute was a stroke of brilliance, in several respects. But let's hope Mr. Iacobucci is a fast reader, and can thereby avoid being used by government as a mere instrument of delay. No doubt the government that prorogued Parliament for two months wishes Mr. Iacobucci a long slog, to be completed some time after the next election, still to be announced. It has not publicly stated the time frame, or terms of reference, for his review of documents related to the alleged torture of Afghan detainees handed over by Canadian soldiers. (The issue is whether national-security and international-relations concerns should keep the documents from being released to a special House of Commons committee.) Mr. Iacobucci has some excellent attributes for this job. As a former Deputy Attorney General in Ottawa, he's no purist; he knows the imperatives of government. As a former Supreme Court judge, he brings legal heft. And having recently headed an inquiry into the Canadian role in the Syrian torture of three Arab-Canadians, he is trusted by government on national-security issues. He has political credibility, too, since he pressed the government successfully over what he saw as its excessive secrecy in one area connected to that inquiry. The government has little credibility on Afghan detainees. It would not, for instance, release documents requested by Peter Tinsley, who was the chair of the Military Police Complaints Commission and whose appointment was not renewed. It attacked the credibility of Richard Colvin, a Canadian diplomat who told the House committee on Afghanistan that the government was willfully blind to what was happening to the detainees. Its senior ministers have repeatedly made false statements on the detainees issue. By appointing Mr. Iacobucci, the government cannot be said to be trying to skew the result. Justice will be seen to be done. It may seem eons ago, but before the Olympics and prorogation Parliament was deeply engaged in holding the government to account over the issue of the Afghan detainees. Beyond the direct import of the detainees issue - Canada's attitude to torture in war - is the question of whether this government tells the truth to Canadians about aspects of the war they are paying for, and dying in. This is not a trifling matter. The documents will help reveal the truth. If Mr. Iacobucci reads quickly enough, the House committee may yet get to the bottom of it. 231 of 266 DOCUMENTS The Globe and Mail (Canada) May 1, 2010 Saturday THE WORLD PUTS ON A SHOW FOR CHINA; Expo has brought 189 nations to Shanghai, to tap into the biggest market on Earth after a global recession. For the Communist Party, this is China's moment At 63 metres high, the inverted crimson pyramid hangs over Shanghai's waterfront, dwarfing the 200 other newly built structures around it. Designed to resemble an ancient crown, the China Pavilion in the centre of the sprawling Expo 2010 grounds along the Huangpu River is very much the powerful host surrounded by rings of anxious-to-please guests. The opening of Expo 2010 following the spectacular fireworks display that rivalled the stunning opening ceremonies of the Beijing Olympics two years ago, represents the fulfilment of a century-old Chinese ambition to hold the World's Fair in Shanghai. The near-full attendance at the six-month-long event - 189 of the world's 196 countries are to take part - reflects how the Middle Kingdom has moved from the ranks of the world's envious to the envied. If the Beijing Olympics marked the moment China asserted itself as a global power after decades of isolation, the Shanghai Expo represents the world's acknowledgment of that new status, with developing countries in particular fighting a battle to show which among them is friendliest with this emerging superpower. ""It's a coming-of-age party,"" said Mark Rowswell, the Ottawa-born television host who is a massive celebrity in China and Canada's commissioner-general to Expo 2010. ""The Olympics was a chance for China to put on a show for the world. The Expo is the flipside of that - the world trying to put on a show for China."" Indeed, some 95 per cent of the 100 million people who are expected to pass through Expo's turnstiles over the coming six months are expected to be Chinese. In true Chinese style, it will be the largest and most expensive World's Fair in the 149-year history of the event. Just as Beijing did two years ago, this city of 20 million people has transformed itself for Expo. Some $59-billion was reportedly spent on the 5.3-square-kilometre site that spans both sides of the Huangpu , as well as new subway lines, a new airport terminal and an overhaul of the city's signature Bund riverfront stroll. Since Queen Victoria summoned the world to Hyde Park for first World's Fair in 1851, Expos have repeatedly been used to herald the arrival of new forces on the international stage. The Eiffel Tower was built in Paris for the 1889 World's Fair, and a trio of early 20th century exhibitions in the United States showcased the speed with which the U.S. was overtaking the conflict-ridden powers of Europe. Recalling that history, China's ruling Communist Party clearly views the event as a declaration that this is China's moment. ""Countries around the world insist on attending the Shanghai Expo because their attendance will boost the world economy, just as the 1933 Chicago World Expo did when the United States was mired in the worst economic crisis in its history,"" read an editorial on the state-run Xinhua news wire this week, noting that the U.S. went on to lead a ""century of progress."" ""The Crown of the East"" - China's $220-million architectural statement - is followed on the lavish list at Expo by the $164-million Saudi Arabian pavilion, which is shaped like a giant oil barge and includes imported date palms, a mosque and a soccer-field-sized video screen to display photographs and footage of King Abdullah meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao. The homage reflects the tightening relations between the world's biggest oil exporter and its fastest growing market. ""This is a symbol of how the China-Saudi relationship has advanced over the past few years ... China for the past few years has emerged as an open and welcome country. I think the future is very brilliant,"" said Mohammed al-Ghandi, executive director of the Saudi pavilion. The pavilion will stage the unveiling of new business deals between China and Saudi Arabia, he said, including the announcement tomorrow that a Chinese firm has been contracted to build a new railway connecting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. The theme of Expo 2010 is urbanization - the ubiquitous motto is ""better city, better life"" - though as with past world fairs, most national pavilions are dedicated to showing off that country's cultural and technological achievements. The French pavilion will feature works from the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and will host ""mass weddings."" Poland's will have daily Chopin recitals, while Japan will go one better by having robots play the violin. Even Taiwan is here, with a pavilion highlighted by liquid electronic displays and senior politicians in attendance at last night's opening ceremony. Twenty heads of state, including Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, attended the opening ceremonies. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il's deputy, Kim Yong-nam, are both in Shanghai, as are members of the Saudi royal family. In an age of international acrimony, perhaps only China - with its trade-focused, non-interventionist foreign policy - could draw this many countries to a trade fair. Syria, Belarus and Zimbabwe have pavilions, returning the embrace Beijing gave them after the United States and Europe turned away for them for human-rights abuses and other reasons. In a corner of Expo sure to catch the eye of U.S. diplomats stationed in the city, the pavilions of North Korea, Iran and Lebanon sit side by side by side. Perhaps most symbolic of Beijing's growing influence in parts of the world the West once held sway over is the joint African pavilion, which hosts 42 countries under one roof. The largest pavilion on the site, the entire tab was picked up by the Chinese government to ensure that as many countries as possible were in attendance. ""China is very important to the whole of the world, and especially to Tanzania and to Africa. China has contributed a lot, first in the decolonization process in Africa, and after they have supported us economically,"" said Omar Mapuri, Tanzania's ambassador to Beijing. ""It's a win-win relationship for both. China is looking for [resources] in Africa, and of course we're looking for [access to] the biggest market in the world."" Critics say the international response is motivated primarily by fear that those who did not attend would suffer in terms of access to the world's largest market. ""You've always had to pay the price if you want to do business here. You have to pay tribute to the Emperor,"" said Paul French, a Shanghai-based writer and consultant. ""Governments feel, and I don't think they're wrong about this, that the Chinese would somehow penalize them, as they do whenever a Western leader has a cup of tea with the Dalai Lama."" Notable absentees include the Vatican, which has no diplomatic relations with China, as well as Kuwait, Bhutan and Burkina Faso, which all pulled out at the last minute after initially confirming participation. Canada's pavilion, which has been roundly criticized for a lack of architectural creativity, may prove to be one of the bigger draws with Cirque du Soleil performers on hand, simulated bicycle rides through animated Canadian cityscapes and a restaurant serving poutine and, once it clears customs, Moosehead beer. But the emphasis, as with all the pavilions, is on increasing economic links to the world's fastest growing economy and its 1.3 billion people. The most important rooms in the Canadian pavilion will likely be the VIP suite sponsored by Montreal's Power Corp., as well as a corporate boardroom built with money from Bombardier Inc. ""I don't think Canada is here because we're intimidated. We're here because it's such a great opportunity,"" Mr. Rowswell said. Those least enamoured with China's over-the-top hosting of Expo are Shanghai residents, who have put up with their city's downtown core being turned into a construction site for much of the past eight years and who began griping months ago about the traffic snarls created by the event. Some 18,000 homes were bulldozed to clear the Expo site, angering many who said they were evicted against their will without being properly compensated. Despite the international nature of Expo, many see the true audience as domestic. To a public angered by rampant official corruption and the widening gap between the country's rich and poor, the message is that the world recognizes how successful the Communist Party has been in guiding the country. ""To the outside world, [the government] wants to show that we're a big power. Domestically, they want to demonstrate that this is an extremely prosperous time,"" said Zhu Dake, a professor in the institute of cultural criticism at Shanghai's Tongji University. ""This can be called the longest carnival in Chinese history."" The Universal Exposition, or Expo, has repeatedly been used as a coming-of-age party for countries looking to establish themselves on the world stage: Britain's showcase The first World's Fair, as it was then known, was held in London in 1851. A showcase for the British Empire at its height under Queen Victoria, it marked the beginning of the Industrial Age. The Fair was attended by the likes of Charles Darwin, Charlotte Bronte and Lewis Carroll. Displays included the Jacquard loom, the Koh-I-Noor diamond and an early version of what would eventually become the fax machine. Eiffel's debut L'Exposition universelle held in Paris in 1889 is most famous for bringing the city the Eiffel Tower, which was initially constructed as a gate to the fair ground. The exposition also featured works by Paul Gauguin and Vincent Van Gogh, as well as sharp-shooting shows by Buffalo Bill and Annie Oakley. U.S.'s rising power A series of World's Fairs held in 1904 in St. Louis, 1915 in San Francisco and 1933 in Chicago helped mark the rise of the United States as a great power. The latter Expo featured the latest automobile designs by Cadillac and Lincoln, as well as an appearance by the German airship Graf Zeppelin. Japan's return Expo 1970 in Osaka is seen as the moment Japan returned to the forefront of international affairs after its defeat in the Second World War. Canada's coming of age Some also argue that Canada's most prominent period on the global stage began with Expo 1967 in Montreal, ending with the Summer Olympics in the same city nine years later. ""I've been saying to people here that Canadians get Expo because we had such a large Expo in 1967,"" said Mark Rowswell, commissioner-general of the Canadian Pavilion in Shanghai. ""It was our coming-of-age party as a serious middle power on the world stage."" Expo's demise In recent years, Expo, which is held at irregular intervals, has lost much of the significance it once held. Recent fairs, such as Expo 2005 in Aichi, Japan, and Expo 2008 in Zaragoza, Spain, have served to primarily to promote lesser-known parts of their respective countries, and received little international attention. Expo 2012 will be held in Yeosu, South Korea. Mark MacKinnon 232 of 266 DOCUMENTS The Globe and Mail (Canada) May 1, 2010 Saturday THE WORLD PUTS ON A SHOW FOR CHINA; Expo has brought 189 nations to Shanghai, to tap into the biggest market on Earth after a global recession. For the Communist Party, this is China's moment At 63 metres high, the inverted crimson pyramid hangs over Shanghai's waterfront, dwarfing the 200 other newly built structures around it. Designed to resemble an ancient crown, the China Pavilion in the centre of the sprawling Expo 2010 grounds along the Huangpu River is very much the powerful host surrounded by rings of anxious-to-please guests. The opening of Expo 2010 following the spectacular fireworks display that rivalled the stunning opening ceremonies of the Beijing Olympics two years ago, represents the fulfilment of a century-old Chinese ambition to hold the World's Fair in Shanghai. The near-full attendance at the six-month-long event - 189 of the world's 196 countries are to take part - reflects how the Middle Kingdom has moved from the ranks of the world's envious to the envied. If the Beijing Olympics marked the moment China asserted itself as a global power after decades of isolation, the Shanghai Expo represents the world's acknowledgment of that new status, with developing countries in particular fighting a battle to show which among them is friendliest with this emerging superpower. ""It's a coming-of-age party,"" said Mark Rowswell, the Ottawa-born television host who is a massive celebrity in China and Canada's commissioner-general to Expo 2010. ""The Olympics was a chance for China to put on a show for the world. The Expo is the flipside of that - the world trying to put on a show for China."" Indeed, some 95 per cent of the 100 million people who are expected to pass through Expo's turnstiles over the coming six months are expected to be Chinese. In true Chinese style, it will be the largest and most expensive World's Fair in the 149-year history of the event. Just as Beijing did two years ago, this city of 20 million people has transformed itself for Expo. Some $59-billion was reportedly spent on the 5.3-square-kilometre site that spans both sides of the Huangpu , as well as new subway lines, a new airport terminal and an overhaul of the city's signature Bund riverfront stroll. Since Queen Victoria summoned the world to Hyde Park for first World's Fair in 1851, Expos have repeatedly been used to herald the arrival of new forces on the international stage. The Eiffel Tower was built in Paris for the 1889 World's Fair, and a trio of early 20th century exhibitions in the United States showcased the speed with which the U.S. was overtaking the conflict-ridden powers of Europe. Recalling that history, China's ruling Communist Party clearly views the event as a declaration that this is China's moment. ""Countries around the world insist on attending the Shanghai Expo because their attendance will boost the world economy, just as the 1933 Chicago World Expo did when the United States was mired in the worst economic crisis in its history,"" read an editorial on the state-run Xinhua news wire this week, noting that the U.S. went on to lead a ""century of progress."" ""The Crown of the East"" - China's $220-million architectural statement - is followed on the lavish list at Expo by the $164-million Saudi Arabian pavilion, which is shaped like a giant oil barge and includes imported date palms, a mosque and a soccer-field-sized video screen to display photographs and footage of King Abdullah meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao. The homage reflects the tightening relations between the world's biggest oil exporter and its fastest growing market. ""This is a symbol of how the China-Saudi relationship has advanced over the past few years ... China for the past few years has emerged as an open and welcome country. I think the future is very brilliant,"" said Mohammed al-Ghandi, executive director of the Saudi pavilion. The pavilion will stage the unveiling of new business deals between China and Saudi Arabia, he said, including the announcement tomorrow that a Chinese firm has been contracted to build a new railway connecting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. The theme of Expo 2010 is urbanization - the ubiquitous motto is ""better city, better life"" - though as with past world fairs, most national pavilions are dedicated to showing off that country's cultural and technological achievements. The French pavilion will feature works from the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and will host ""mass weddings."" Poland's will have daily Chopin recitals, while Japan will go one better by having robots play the violin. Even Taiwan is here, with a pavilion highlighted by liquid electronic displays and senior politicians in attendance at last night's opening ceremony. Twenty heads of state, including Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, attended the opening ceremonies. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il's deputy, Kim Yong-nam, are both in Shanghai, as are members of the Saudi royal family. In an age of international acrimony, perhaps only China - with its trade-focused, non-interventionist foreign policy - could draw this many countries to a trade fair. Syria, Belarus and Zimbabwe have pavilions, returning the embrace Beijing gave them after the United States and Europe turned away for them for human-rights abuses and other reasons. In a corner of Expo sure to catch the eye of U.S. diplomats stationed in the city, the pavilions of North Korea, Iran and Lebanon sit side by side by side. Perhaps most symbolic of Beijing's growing influence in parts of the world the West once held sway over is the joint African pavilion, which hosts 42 countries under one roof. The largest pavilion on the site, the entire tab was picked up by the Chinese government to ensure that as many countries as possible were in attendance. ""China is very important to the whole of the world, and especially to Tanzania and to Africa. China has contributed a lot, first in the decolonization process in Africa, and after they have supported us economically,"" said Omar Mapuri, Tanzania's ambassador to Beijing. ""It's a win-win relationship for both. China is looking for [resources] in Africa, and of course we're looking for [access to] the biggest market in the world."" Critics say the international response is motivated primarily by fear that those who did not attend would suffer in terms of access to the world's largest market. ""You've always had to pay the price if you want to do business here. You have to pay tribute to the Emperor,"" said Paul French, a Shanghai-based writer and consultant. ""Governments feel, and I don't think they're wrong about this, that the Chinese would somehow penalize them, as they do whenever a Western leader has a cup of tea with the Dalai Lama."" Notable absentees include the Vatican, which has no diplomatic relations with China, as well as Kuwait, Bhutan and Burkina Faso, which all pulled out at the last minute after initially confirming participation. Canada's pavilion, which has been roundly criticized for a lack of architectural creativity, may prove to be one of the bigger draws with Cirque du Soleil performers on hand, simulated bicycle rides through animated Canadian cityscapes and a restaurant serving poutine and, once it clears customs, Moosehead beer. But the emphasis, as with all the pavilions, is on increasing economic links to the world's fastest growing economy and its 1.3 billion people. The most important rooms in the Canadian pavilion will likely be the VIP suite sponsored by Montreal's Power Corp., as well as a corporate boardroom built with money from Bombardier Inc. ""I don't think Canada is here because we're intimidated. We're here because it's such a great opportunity,"" Mr. Rowswell said. Those least enamoured with China's over-the-top hosting of Expo are Shanghai residents, who have put up with their city's downtown core being turned into a construction site for much of the past eight years and who began griping months ago about the traffic snarls created by the event. Some 18,000 homes were bulldozed to clear the Expo site, angering many who said they were evicted against their will without being properly compensated. Despite the international nature of Expo, many see the true audience as domestic. To a public angered by rampant official corruption and the widening gap between the country's rich and poor, the message is that the world recognizes how successful the Communist Party has been in guiding the country. ""To the outside world, [the government] wants to show that we're a big power. Domestically, they want to demonstrate that this is an extremely prosperous time,"" said Zhu Dake, a professor in the institute of cultural criticism at Shanghai's Tongji University. ""This can be called the longest carnival in Chinese history."" The Universal Exposition, or Expo, has repeatedly been used as a coming-of-age party for countries looking to establish themselves on the world stage: Britain's showcase The first World's Fair, as it was then known, was held in London in 1851. A showcase for the British Empire at its height under Queen Victoria, it marked the beginning of the Industrial Age. The Fair was attended by the likes of Charles Darwin, Charlotte Bronte and Lewis Carroll. Displays included the Jacquard loom, the Koh-I-Noor diamond and an early version of what would eventually become the fax machine. Eiffel's debut L'Exposition universelle held in Paris in 1889 is most famous for bringing the city the Eiffel Tower, which was initially constructed as a gate to the fair ground. The exposition also featured works by Paul Gauguin and Vincent Van Gogh, as well as sharp-shooting shows by Buffalo Bill and Annie Oakley. U.S.'s rising power A series of World's Fairs held in 1904 in St. Louis, 1915 in San Francisco and 1933 in Chicago helped mark the rise of the United States as a great power. The latter Expo featured the latest automobile designs by Cadillac and Lincoln, as well as an appearance by the German airship Graf Zeppelin.

Mark MacKinnon 233 of 266 DOCUMENTS The Globe and Mail (Canada) June 5, 2010 Saturday Israeli commando raid is a gift to Hamas; No one could have predicted the fallout from this week's flotilla fiasco. And the consequences are still flowing, with the Islamic Resistance Movement appearing stronger than ever pmartin@globeandmail.com Israel's ill-fated boarding operation of the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara has become a nightmare for the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, but a dream come true for the leaders of Hamas. And it's not over yet. The vessel Rachel Corrie, an Irish boat carrying more humanitarian supplies and yet more activists, is on course to arrive in Gaza as early as Saturday. The Israeli government has said it will not allow the vessel to reach Gaza and will board it if necessary. Just a week ago, the whole situation looked dramatically different. Gaza's tiny, shallow-water port was getting a cleanup and the area was decorated with Turkish flags and signs welcoming ""the heroes"" on board the flotilla then on route to Gaza. When word arrived that several of the eight vessels in the flotilla had engine trouble, however, it all suddenly seemed pathetic. No one had actually believed the boats would get through the three-year-old Israeli naval blockade, but engine trouble? Even if the hand of the Mossad could be detected, that wasn't going to produce the kind of headlines the Hamas leadership craved. No one, however, could have imagined the turn of events about to take place, and the consequences that still are flowing from it. ""It was a perfect storm,"" said Paul Heinbecker, a former Canadian ambassador to the United Nations. ""It couldn't have gone worse for Israel. In football, we used to call it 'stumble, fumble and fall.' "" With nine activists killed, its defence forces embarrassed and world opinion arrayed against Israel, the Netanyahu government has begun to pay a price for its action. U.S. officials, including President Barack Obama, have made it clear that the blockade of Gaza will have to change, and Israel's security needs otherwise assured. But easing the blockade is just the beginning. Of far greater importance to Israel is the boost that its dreaded enemy, Hamas, has received. Israeli efforts to wear down the group, through large-scale bombardment a year-and-a-half ago, through a virtual siege the past three years and through the imprisonment of thousands of Hamas members, have failed. Now, with the events of this week, the Islamic Resistance Movement (its full name) appears stronger than ever. Israel's hopes of isolating Gaza from the West Bank Palestinian Authority led by Mahmoud Abbas have also been dashed, as Palestinians throughout the West Bank embrace Gaza once again. Even Mr. Abbas has publicly expressed the gratitude of all Palestinians to the Turkish government for supporting the flotilla and standing up to Israel, even though Mr. Abbas detests Hamas for its overthrow of his forces in Gaza in 2007, and fears Hamas's political power. And it doesn't end there. Just this week, the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence service warned members of Israel's Knesset that Turkey was aligning itself with Syria and Iran and forming a new anti-Israel coalition. That prospect got a lot more likely this week. The Israeli assault on the Turkish ship ""has guaranteed the re-election of the Islamists in Turkey,"" said Mr. Heinbecker. ""Until this week, the new leader of the opposition, a secularist, had a good chance at winning the next election,"" he said. ""But now [Prime Minister Recep] Erdogan has been strengthened enormously."" If Mr. Erdogan has been strengthened, the campaign to invoke tough sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program have been sorely weakened, added Mr. Heinbecker. ""People know that the campaign against Iran is particularly dear to Netanyahu, so they're less likely to support it now."" ""The whole campaign could go belly up,"" he said. Globally, Israel may be paying a big price as well, as the worldwide campaign to boycott Israel is sure to grow, said Nehemia Shtrasler in his Friday economics column in the Haaretz newspaper. Writing about politics and the flotilla may seem strange in a business-section column, but Mr. Shtrasler explains that it is because of ""the unprecedented nadir to which Israel's status in the world has sunk - to the point of the delegitimization of the state. That,"" he says, ""is a strategic threat to Israel."" To be sure, Israel's weekend press contained lots of congratulatory articles praising the performance of the commandos who boarded the Mavi Marmara (though the large-circulation Yedioth Ahronoth revealed that the military preferred not to release certain videos in which, according to the newspaper, Israeli ""soldiers are seen unclothed and bleeding, being beaten badly and crying for help."") However, every painful setback for the Netanyahu government is a cause for celebration by Hamas. For three years, its leaders have been telling the people of Gaza to hold on, that better days would be coming, that the siege would be lifted. They tried firing thousands of home-made rockets at Israel to little effect, and weathered a massive retaliatory onslaught by Israeli forces in December-January 2008-09 that killed 1,300 Gazans. It took the deaths of nine international activists, most of them Turkish, to make a difference. Easing the blockade is just one way Hamas stands to benefit, said Beverley Milton-Edwards, co-author of a new book, Hamas: The Islamic Resistance Movement. ""And they don't even have to raise a finger - Israel is handing it to them on a platter."" Another way Hamas can gain, she said in an interview, ""is by the support it can pick up around the region."" While Turkey's Islamic-oriented government has always supported Hamas, many of the Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt, have sided with the Palestinian Authority of Mr. Abbas in its struggle with Hamas. Not necessarily any more. ""Khaled Meshaal [Hamas's Damascus-based leader] is playing it very carefully this week,"" said Dr. Milton-Edwards, a professor of Mideast politics at Queen's University, Belfast. ""He went to Yemen, for example, and made a quiet appeal for regional help."" The result has been a large increase in support from the countries of the Arab League, including Egypt, which felt the need to open its frontier with Gaza, at least, to a limited degree. (It had been closed in support of the PA.) ""The Egyptian government is in a double bind,"" said Ezzedine Choukri Fishere, a former adviser to Egypt's Foreign Minister. ""It doesn't want to see the growth of the radical view in the region, but it has to stand firmly with the Arab League,"" he said. But the big prize that still awaits Hamas is recognition by the capitals of the West. ""A lot of people are starting to ask themselves if there can be a successful peace process without Hamas,"" said Dr. Milton-Edwards. Even the consensus of the Quartet (the United States, European Union, Russia and the United Nations) is fracturing, she said. ""But so far this has not resulted in recognition in the West, only in support of a lifting of the blockade."" For its part, Hamas is preaching reconciliation. In a remarkable commentary in the weekend edition of Jerusalem's main Arab newspaper, Al Quds, Ahmed Yousef, the Hamas government's deputy foreign minister, called on all Palestinians to recognize that the correct path for the Islamic movement is to follow the conciliatory approach of Turkey's Islamic party, rather than the violent exclusionary approach of Afghanistan's Taliban. ""We are at a crossroads,"" Mr. Yousef wrote. ""We have to choose between realizing our dreams and suicide."" 234 of 266 DOCUMENTS The Globe and Mail (Canada) June 11, 2010 Friday Erdogan seizes the moment in shifting Mideast; Turkish leader is emerging as the most popular leader in the Muslim and Arab worlds after criticism of Israel pmartin@globeandmail.com To some people, he's a stalwart Islamist, author of the biggest Islamic revolution since Iran's in 1979. To others, he's a pragmatist bringing human rights to Turkey and providing a bridge between the West and the Islamic world. Either way, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is the international man of the moment. His support for last week's Free-Gaza flotilla and his outcry against Israel for its deadly boarding of a Turkish ship, have made him the most admired leader in the Muslim and Arab worlds, shaming those who have done so little for the Palestinians. It's not easy being an Islamist in Turkey where political Islam was banned in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. But there's no denying that Mr. Erdogan (pronounced AIR-doe-awn) has deep Islamic roots. Fifteen years ago, in a Globe and Mail interview, Abdullah Gul, then deputy leader of Turkey's Islamic party (known as the Welfare party) talked about his concerns in trying to build popular support in officially secular Turkey. ""Practising Muslims are not enough to elect us,"" he explained. ""We wouldn't stay in power very long, if we forgot that."" Mr. Gul acknowledged that some party members got carried away with religious enthusiasm. He pointed to the pledge by the newly elected mayor of Istanbul to tear down the city's Byzantine walls because they predated the Islamic period, as the kind of thing the party had to avoid. ""Our aim is next year's [1996] election,"" Mr. Gul said, when explaining why such extreme views needed to be curbed. Today, Abdullah Gul is President of Turkey, and that mayor of Istanbul was none other than Mr. Erdogan, now Prime Minister of Turkey, and the person at the centre of controversy. Veteran observers say the man hasn't changed. ""He's as deeply rooted in Islam as ever,"" says Oktay Eksi, a leading columnist for the Hurriyet newspaper. ""For a while, he succeeded in covering it over, but now it's showing again."" Mr. Erdogan's 1994 election as mayor of Istanbul came as a shock to Turks: an avowed Islamist running the secular country's biggest, most sophisticated city. But, by all accounts he was better at the job than most of his predecessors. Honest, hard working, he had what political scientist Metin Heper called ""an Islamic version of the Protestant work ethic."" Mayor Erdogan is credited with laying hundreds of kilometres of pipeline to solve the city's water shortage, with bringing in modern recycling facilities, and building more than 50 bridges and viaducts to relieve Istanbul's traffic congestion. He never did implement his vow to tear down the Byzantine walls, but he did ban the sale of alcohol in city facilities (a measure he later reversed). That's not to say he forsook Islam. Indeed, before he left office he was charged with religious incitement of hatred and sent to prison, for reciting this poem at a political rally: The mosques are our barracks, The domes our helmets, The minarets our bayonets, And the believers our soldiers. He emerged from prison in 2000 a different man. ""Prison matures you,"" Mr. Erdogan said at the time. ""He hadn't fundamentally changed,"" Mr. Eksi said. ""He just learned that it didn't pay to profess his religious views in public."" With other Islamists, such as Mr. Gul, he set about creating a new party, the Justice and Development Party (AKP), that would keep its Islamic roots more concealed. His wife, for example, who wears the head scarf of a devout Muslim, no longer appeared in public with Mr. Erdogan. He built a large following in the business community, expanding on the network of Muslim business people already in place. The party ran on a platform of honesty, a free market and membership in the European Union, and it won the 2003 election - the first majority government in 15 years. However, because of his conviction, Mr. Erdogan, leader of the AKP, couldn't run for Parliament himself. Mr. Gul kept the prime minister's seat warm for him until the legislature could pass a law overturning the ban. But even as prime minister-in-waiting, Mr. Erdogan flitted about European capitals stumping for Turkey's membership in the EU. He certainly sounded convincing; to no avail. Europe repeatedly turned down Mr. Erdogan, and some, such as U.S. Secretary of Defence Robert Gates just this week, say that may be what is turning the Turkish Prime Minister increasingly to the Muslim world. Oktay Eksi doesn't buy it. The EU campaign was never really about getting membership, he says. ""That didn't matter to Erdogan. What he needed was support in the West to overcome the secularists [in Turkey]."" Mr. Erdogan had always been looked down on by Turkey's secular establishment. ""I have faced this all my life,"" he said in a 2003 interview. Mr. Erdogan was raised in a rough neighbourhood of Istanbul and sent by his authoritarian father to religious schools. He has described how his father once hung him from the ceiling by the arms for using foul language. ""I never swore again,"" he is quoted as saying by a biographer. He was a devoted follower of a previous Islamic political leader, Necmettin Erbakan, who briefly held national power in 1996 when the Welfare Party finished first in a tight race. But that leader made the mistake of trying to push an Islamic agenda, and the military, keepers of Ataturk's secular legacy, forced him from office. That, and his own conviction, taught Mr. Erdogan to be careful. ""A political party cannot have a religion,"" he said shortly after his 2003 election. ""Only individuals can. Otherwise, you'd be exploiting religion, and religion is so supreme that it cannot be exploited or taken advantage of."" The new Prime Minister eschewed expensive clothes and presented himself as a man of the people, not unlike Iran's populist President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The New York Times' Deborah Sontag wrote: ""As a devout Muslim with an Islamist past who had nonetheless evolved into a modern, pro-Western democrat, Erdogan had the potential to set a powerful example for the region ... in which Islamic faith and democratic principles not only co-existed but also collaborated."" A lot of people believed that. Combined with economic reforms that saw public debt fall and the GDP rise, Mr. Erdogan's AKP enjoyed an even greater victory in the 2007 election - the first time in half a century that a party had increased its popular support. After that, observers say, Mr. Erdogan began to show his true colours, banking on his increased majority to overcome any remaining secular opposition. He offered peace to the country's Kurds and an opening of relations with Turkey's historic foe Armenia. He established good relations with Iraq and even with its Kurdish Regional Government that sits on Turkey's border. More controversially, he entered into new deals with Syria, promoted Hamas, the Palestinians' Islamic resistance movement, and showed off his warm relations with Iran, all of which contradicted past Turkish policy. There is ""no doubt he's our friend,"" Mr. Erdogan said of the Iranian President, and announced he did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon. Most recently, he has pulled the rug out from under the once-close alliance Turkey had with Israel, leaving many to wonder if it can ever be restored or if Mr. Erdogan will soon consolidate his government's commitment to a radical new alliance of Middle East states. Inside Turkey, the controversial issue of women's head scarves has taken centre stage. Mr. Erdogan's repeated efforts to lift the ban on women wearing head scarves in public institutions such as universities have all been thwarted by the courts. Now, he's determined to try to change them. A referendum in September will let the people vote on constitutional amendments that would eliminate the separation of the courts and give the government control over them and appointments to them. Will it pass? ""It will depend on the issues of the day,"" Mr. Eksi said. ""If there's another incident like last week's flotilla, for sure he'll win."" 235 of 266 DOCUMENTS The Globe and Mail (Canada) September 11, 2010 Saturday Politics, God and Tony Blair; Britain's former PM is still struggling with his conscience over the invasion of Iraq My Political Life By Tony Blair Knopf Canada, 700 pages, $40 If Tony Blair has not continued to agonize over the tough decisions of his prime ministership, he does a pretty good job of persuading otherwise in A Journey. Reading the former British leader's nearly 700-page memoir, you can almost feel his pain. Unless, of course, you're among the legions (more so in Britain than on this side of the pond) who subscribe to the Phony Tony depiction of Blair. If so, the pain you feel reading this book will be entirely your own. Blair offers up an earnest attempt to explain the motivations and thought processes that led him to break with international opinion and most of his own Labour Party to join George W. Bush's 2003 invasion of Iraq. At the end of it, you're not entirely sure he has convinced himself, much less the reader. But you cannot help but commiserate, for this is a man (unlike some other world leaders) who has clearly grappled with his conscience. Domestic politics figure prominently in the book, of course, but for non-British readers, none of it is quite as compelling as the segments devoted to foreign policy. After all, for observers at home and abroad, foreign policy defined his years in office, from 1997 to 2007. That is perhaps the most consequential irony to emerge from this engaging - though occasionally corny - account of his ""political life."" ""I knew a lot about history before becoming prime minister; but about contemporary foreign affairs, I knew little,"" Blair writes. ""The 1997 campaign was fought almost exclusively on a domestic policy basis."" Like most stints in power, Blair's started out in euphoria and ended on a decidedly more prosaic, if not depressing, note. Who can forget the early Blair years of Cool Britannia? Blair's New Labour, an electable version of the corduroy-clad, ultra-orthodox party he inherited, transformed British politics, the post-Thatcher national psyche and the country's international image. ""It affected everyone,"" Blair recalls, ""lifting them up, giving them hope, making them believe all things were possible, that by the very act of election and the spirit surrounding it, the world could be changed."" In the end, Tony Blair did change the world, just not in the way he or his compatriots imagined he would in 1997. It is entirely conceivable that, domestically, the era of New Labour could have emerged under Gordon Brown, alternately Blair's political soulmate, chancellor of the exchequer, chief rival and successor. But it is harder to fathom British foreign policy, under any other Labour chief, following the path it did under Blair. The reason lies in Blair's Christian faith. Readers looking for a detailed description of his spiritual journey and ultimate conversion (in 2007) to Catholicism will be disappointed in this book. But he does not entirely shy away from it. Indeed, his discussions of moral considerations in his foreign policy-making might be seen as an attempt at explaining his philosophy in terms befitting secular consumption. Blair confirms most of what has been written about his mentor, Peter Thomson, the Australian-born Anglican priest he met as a young man at Oxford and whose death shortly before A Journey was finished perhaps made his memory even more poignant for its author. ""Probably the most influential person in my life,"" Blair writes of Thomson. ""Politically, Peter was on the left, but religion came first. Therefore, so, in a sense, it did for me. ... This is vital in understanding my politics."" Blair admits that he would have been ""bewildered and horrified"" if, in 1997, someone had told him he would lead his country into four wars as prime minister. He depicts the first of these military interventions, to stop the Serbian-led ethnic cleansing of Albanian Muslims in Kosovo, as one that informed his subsequent decisions on Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and, fatefully, Iraq. As such, Kosovo emboldened him. Joining in Bush's invasion of Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein, on the pretext the latter possessed weapons of mass destruction, will forever define Blair's legacy. He does not shrink from this reality, but instead seeks the reader's indulgence: ""I have often reflected as to whether I was wrong. I ask you to reflect as to whether I may have been right."" In the end, the most he can expect from us is respect. He has anguished over his decisions in a way other leaders have not, at least not publicly. ""George had immense simplicity in how he saw the world. Right or wrong, it led to decisive leadership,"" Blair writes of his American vis-à-vis, whose own memoirs, due out in November, may corroborate this view. Still, the most chilling revelation in A Journey is not about Bush, who emerges from this memoir every bit as one-dimensional as he is portrayed elsewhere. Rather, the author's recollections of former vice-president Dick Cheney make one shudder at the possibilities were the latter still in a position of power. ""He would have worked through the whole lot, Iraq, Syria, Iran, dealing with their surrogates in the course of it - Hezbollah, Hamas, etc.,"" Blair recalls. ""I did not think it was as fantastical as conventional wisdom opined. It is one struggle. Our enemy has an ideology. It does threaten us. The ultimate answer is in the spread of democracy and freedom."" Blair qualifies his position by adding that a ""hard power"" strategy is incomplete on its own. Winning the war of ideas is just as important. But if push came to shove, as it still could with Iran's move toward nuclear capability, the reader is not left doubting where Tony Blair would come down.

Meanwhile, Libyan sources told Al-Sharq al-Awsat that Libya intends to escalate the situation with Iraq in the next few weeks by calling on Arab states to transfer the venue of the Arab summit, which is scheduled to be held in Baghdad next year, to another place. A Libyan diplomat told Al-Sharq al-Awsat: ""It is inconceivable for this summit to be held in light of the current security and military situation in Baghdad."" He said the Iraqi Government's insistence on Baghdad's right to host the summit ""simply means that no Arab leader will participate in this summit."" The Libyan diplomat, who asked not to be identified, added: ""The government in Baghdad has to back down on this insistence and agree on holding the summit in Egypt, the state where the main headquarters of the Arab League is situated."" Arab diplomatic sources expected a severe diplomatic confrontation between Iraq and Libya during meetings of the emergency Arab summit that will be held in the Libyan City of Surt on the ninth of the next month. In a statement posted on its official Website, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said that the UN General Committee decided to unanimously reject the Libyan request to conduct an investigation into the circumstances of the invasion of Iraq and bringing down the regime of late Iraqi President Saddam Husayn in 2003. It added that none of the general committee members supported Libya's request. The Iraqi Foreign Ministry said this unanimity in supporting Iraq and understanding its position is recognition of the importance of the ongoing democratic transitions in Iraq and a support for the political process. It added that this unanimity also shows the soundness of the foreign ministry's way, as directed by the government, in implementing the Iraqi foreign policy and defending the Iraqi people's national interests. Earlier, Libya officially submitted a memorandum to the UN secretary general through its permanent mission in New York asking that an item be included in the UN General Assembly's agenda in its current 65th session to investigate the invasion of Iraq. In this memorandum, Libya expressed its condemnation of the execution of the former Iraqi president. The upcoming summit is expected to discuss two topics, development of the joint Arab action regime and Arab League Secretary General Amr Musa's proposals on the Arab proximity policy. Al-Sharq al-Awsat learned that Libya fears this scheduled summit might fail to push through an ambitious project to turn the Arab League into an Arab union, modelled on the EU and African Union. A report that was submitted to the Libyan leader, Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhafi, yesterday, a copy of which Al-Sharq al-Awsat read, said that the discussions, which were held during the Arab foreign ministers meeting at the Arab League headquarters in Cairo on Thursday, showed that there are deliberate attempts by some Arab states to take the project of developing the joint Arab action regime out of context. The report expected that the planned emergency Arab summit in Surt, Libya, in October will not be easy at all for Libya and its ambition to lead the process of a radical change in the Arab League. The report proposed that intensive contacts be held with the states that are opposed to, or unenthusiastic towards the project, especially Syria, Oman, Morocco, Jordan, and Algeria. The report noted the need to urge all Arab states to assert their eagerness to participate in the upcoming summit at the highest levels in order to ensure that the project will be pushed through.

238,The Western Mail,2010-06-28,Welsh diplomat at UN to join Labour in Lords; MICHAEL WILLIAMS CREDITED WITH HALTING LEBANON WAR,First Edition,wm,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,FEATURES; Pg. 17,"June 28, 2010",848 words,"A TOP Welsh diplomat who helped end Israel's war with Lebanon and is now Under-Secretary General of the United Nations is coming home to join Labour in the House of Lords. Michael Williams is not a household name in Wales - but he is admired around the world as a man to turn to in the heat of a diplomatic crisis. The former comprehensive school pupil from Baglan has been credited with playing a critical role in halting Israel's 2006 conflict with Lebanon and today he represents the UN Secretary General in Lebanon. But soon he will be bringing his cool head to the Palace of Westminster when he takes up his role as one of Labour's newest working peers. He expects to use his new position on the red benches to champion foreign policy and he refuses to despair about the prospects for peace in the Middle East. He is adamant that the UK must not give up on a region synonymous in many minds with political violence and is convinced it is in Israel's interests to see the creation of a Palestinian state. He said: ""It's seen as a great injustice that the Palestinians have been denied the right to nationhood that has been taken for granted by others. He continued: ""I don't believe Israel will be safe until there is a Palestinian state."" Mr Williams believes that there are enough people in Israel who share this conviction to put pressure on the political leaders. He said: ""The settler issue on the West Bank has to some extend distorted Israeli politics but we need the strong voices of moderation to come to the fore again."" The peerage is the latest step in a career which has taken him through academia, broadcasting, diplomacy and conflict zones. His capacity to win trust at the highest levels was demonstrated in 2007 when he became the UK's special representative on the Middle East. Former Welsh Secretary and Labour MP for Neath Peter Hain looks forward to welcoming Mr Williams to his new role in British public life. The two men knew each other when Mr Hain served in the Foreign Office. He said: ""It was great working there with a Welshman who was held in such high regard. He was a very nice man. and I think he'll add a lot of authority to the House of Lords in being able to speak out on international affairs."" His fans include former Foreign Secretary and Labour leadership candidate David Miliband. When the father-oftwo was about to take up his latest UN role, Mr Miliband said the Welshman ""played a critical role in implementing Security Council Resolution 1701 that brought the Israel-Lebanon war to a conclusion"". Mr Williams' decision to accept the invitation to step into the world of politics comes as the Labour party seeks to chart a path to recovery and a return to power. Mr Williams was born in 1949 and attended Sandfields Comprehensive School in Port Talbot, where he excelled academically. He went on to study at University College London before staying in the city to gain a doctorate in Islam and Politics in Indonesia at the School of Oriental and African Studies. His mother, Milly, a retired yoga and PE instructor, remembers him devouring books from the age of five. She also recalls how in later years he would return to Wales to take part in marches with miners in Swansea. He said he had a ""yearning from an early age to travel"". As head of Asia research at Amnesty International he documented human rights throughout the region. From 1984 to 1991 he worked in the BBC World Service, reaching the position of Senior Editor for Asia. This work in the background continued when he went to the United Nations, becoming Director of Human Rights in the United Nations's transitional administration in Cambodia. He jumped into another troublezone when he became Director of Information for the United Nations protection force in former Yugoslavia. He returned to the UK and witnessed politics and diplomacy collide first-hand when he became special adviser to two UK Foreign Secretaries, Robin Cook (1999-2001) and Jack Straw (2001-2005). Mr Williams then moved to New York to head up Asian political affairs at the United Nations before becoming then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's special adviser on Middle East policy. Mr Annan's successor, Ban Ki-moon, also prized Mr Williams' abilities and appointed him special co-ordinator for the Middle East peace process. This involved personally representing the Secretary General in meetings with the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Palestinian Authority. He crossed the Atlantic again in 2007 to replace Labour peer Lord Levy as the UK's special representative in the region. He came to the role urging Britain to engage more with Iran and Syria. But in 2008, when the chance came to take up his present position in Lebanon, he returned to the UN fold. Mr Miliband praised his ""immense expertise and capabilities"" and said he was sad to see him go. Since then he has worked to stabilise a small country wracked by memories of civil war, the tensions between the Hezbollah Islamist militia and the Government, and fall-out from the conflict with Israel."
239,The Jerusalem Post,2010-01-22,The perils of presidential failure,,,Newspaper,HIGHLIGHT: COLUMN ONE,,ENGLISH,OPINION; Pg. 24,"January 26, 2010",1890 words,"US President Barack Obama is feeling the heat. His response to the current crisis threatening to sink his one- year-old presidency is telling for what it says about the future of both his domestic and foreign policies. Israel should take heed of his responses. Obama's Democratic Party, and indeed the US political establishment as a whole, received a jolt on Tuesday when Republican Scott Brown won the Massachusetts seat in the US Senate that had been held by the Democratic Kennedy dynasty since 1952. The question now on everyone's lips is whether Brown's stunning victory will cause Obama to change his course and moderate his policies. The Massachusetts Senate race was a real world example of what opinion polling data has shown. Since last summer, a consistently growing number of US voters oppose Obama's policies. Brown's victory was nationally significant because it removed the Democrats' filibuster proof, 60-man super- majority in the Senate. With Brown as the 41st Republican senator, the minority party can now muster the votes to block legislation from being called to a vote before the full Senate and so prevent laws from being passed. In addition to its immediate legislative significance, the larger political importance of the Massachusetts election rests in what it signals for House and Senate Democrats who will face reelection in November. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers are reportedly now veering into full- blown panics about their prospects in those elections. As Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh put it, ""If you lose Massachusetts and that's not a wake-up call, there's no hope of waking up."" Tellingly, Obama and his White House advisers are refusing to ""wake up."" Obama responded to Brown's win as he has to many of his setbacks since assuming office a year ago this week. He blamed his predecessor, George W. Bush. In an interview on Wednesday with ABC News, Obama said, ""People are angry, they are frustrated. Not just because of what's happened in the last year or two years, but what's happened over the last eight years."" Obama argued that the growing unpopularity of his programs is due not to substance, but to style. As he put it, ""We were so busy just getting stuff done... that I think we lost some of that sense of speaking directly to the American people about what their core values are and why we have to make sure those institutions are matching up with those values."" Even as Democratic lawmakers are openly expressing misgivings with moving forward in implementing Obama's radical plan to reform the US health care industry, Obama's senior adviser David Axelrod told the media that abandoning the initiative is ""not an option."" Rather than accept that Massachusetts voters elected Brown because Brown repudiated Obama's agenda - on both domestic and foreign policy - the Obama White House has argued that Brown's victory was simply the consequence of poor electioneering by the Democratic candidate and poor planning by the national Democratic Party apparatus. Obama's imperiousness is even more apparent when compared to the behavior of his predecessors in office. When in 2006 the Republicans lost control of Congress, George W. Bush responded by embracing the Democrats' policies on everything from Iran to mortgage banks. When the Democrats lost control of Congress in 1994, Bill Clinton adopted the Republicans' ""Contract with America"" as his own. What Obama's refusal to hear Tuesday's ""wake-up call"" from Massachusetts shows is that his chief concern is not listening to what the public says. It is not even remaining in office. Rather, his behavior in the wake of the Brown victory shows that Obama's top concern is enacting his radical political agenda. He is an ideologue first and a party leader second. While his fellow Democrats in Congress say that Brown's election means that Obama's plan to nationalize one-sixth of the US economy through his health care plan is dead in the water, Obama claims the time to move forward is now. As he sees things, he has 11 months left to effect the radical change he seeks for America. Obama believes that plowing ahead is the only thing that will save the Democrats. As he has put it, ""I... know what happens once we get... [health care reform] done. The American people will suddenly learn that this bill does things they like."" Far from slowing down, he will redouble his efforts to ram his agenda down the throats of an unwilling populace. ELECTIONS ARE blunt instruments, not precise readings. Voters cast their ballots for specific politicians and their political parties based on their wide perceptions of general trends rather than on specific policies related to specific issues. Candidates in turn emphasize specific issues because of what those issues symbolize about the general state of affairs. In the US today, there is a widespread public perception that Obama and his party colleagues in the House and Senate have gone on a spending spree when what the deepening economic recession requires is frugality. Obama's plan to spend up to a trillion dollars on nationalized health care in this economic environment is emblematic of the public sense that the national leadership is behaving irresponsibly. A similar view pervades with respect to Obama's foreign policy. Speaking to National Review, Brown's chief political strategist Eric Fehrnstrom said that ""terrorism and the treatment of enemy combatants"" was a ""more potent issue"" for Massachusetts voters than health care. If health care is emblematic of the growing perception that Obama and his fellow Democrats are irresponsible on the domestic policy front, so ""terrorism and the treatment of enemy combatants"" are emblematic of the public perception that Obama's foreign policy is too weak. The administration's failure to detect, prevent or adequately characterize the jihadist massacre at Fort Hood, Texas, like its failure to detect, prevent or adequately handle the aftermath of the attempted airline bombing on Christmas day by a Nigerian jihadist, are viewed by Americans as proof that Obama's foreign policy is weak and dangerous. As with his domestic agenda, in foreign affairs as well, the clear antidote to Obama's political woes would be to change course and moderate his policies. Were Obama interested in ensuring that the public supported and trusted his handling of American foreign policy, he would repudiate his plan to transfer terrorists now jailed at Guantanamo Bay to Yemen and cancel his plan to try senior terrorists like September 11 architect Khaled Sheikh Muhammad in civilian trials. But rather than do so, Obama has responded to the public's opposition to his foreign policies by doubling down. In the face of massive criticism over his administration's decision to try the September 11 mastermind in a civilian courtroom in New York, the administration opted to treat the Christmas bomber as a criminal defendant as well. Indeed, as its top counterterror officials made clear in Senate testimony on Wednesday, the administration never considered treating the terrorist as an illegal enemy combatant. In a related matter, on Wednesday the State Department announced that the US has dropped its opposition to permitting Islamist leader Tariq Ramadan from entering the US. Ramadan - whose grandfather founded the Muslim Brotherhood which spawned the likes of al-Qaida and Hamas - is a hero of the far Left in the US and Europe. He was barred from entering the US since 2004 due in part to his personal contributions to Hamas. In short then, rather than respond to the public's rejection of his posture of weakness abroad by replacing that posture with one of strength, Obama has ratcheted up his policy of weakness. What this shows is that like his domestic agenda, Obama's foreign policy - including his national security policy - is the product of his firmly held beliefs and ideological commitments. Obama is weak on foreign affairs because he chooses to be weak. Through both his actions and his words he demonstrates his belief that the US must adopt a posture of contrition to make up for its past global leadership. His goal is to weaken America's position in the international arena, because he doesn't believe that America has a moral right to be stronger than anyone else. Given the congressional backlash to the Massachusetts election, it is possible that Obama will be compelled to put aside his domestic initiatives, or at least to repackage them. US presidents have only a limited capacity to unilaterally implement massive changes on the domestic front. Congressional support is required for most major endeavors. Today, it seems likely that many Democratic lawmakers will refuse to fall on their swords for Obama. So his health care initiative, like his environmental and immigration agendas, may well be buried in committee. On the other hand, the US Constitution gives the president a much freer hand in foreign affairs. And here we are likely to see a full-court presidential press to force through his radical agenda on everything from nuclear weapons to counterterrorism to appeasement of the Islamic world. Given the prominence Obama has already given to his anti-Israel posture, it can be assumed that Israel will be the focus of even more intense pressure from the White House in the months and years to come. All of this should concentrate the minds of Israel's leaders. They should assume that Obama's Middle East envoy George Mitchell will intensify his pressure - and escalate his threats - on Israel to make massive concessions to the Palestinians. Indeed, given Mitchell's trip this week to Lebanon and Syria and Obama's refusal to end his appeasement overtures towards Iran, Israel should expect the US to expand its pressure on Israel to agree to imperil itself on all fronts. SINCE TAKING office on March 31, the Netanyahu government has adopted two distinct policies for dealing with Obama. Until September, the government's policy was to politely delay as long as possible its ultimate polite refusal to accept US demands for more concessions to Palestinians. After Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's meeting with Obama at the UN in September, however, he adopted a new policy of caving in to US pressure. First he reiterated his support for Palestinian statehood. Then he agreed to bar Jews from receiving construction permits in Judea and Samaria. Apparently, Netanyahu was led to believe that his concessions would cause Obama to ease his pressure on Israel. But as the White House's escalating threats and demands for new Israeli concessions in the wake of Netanyahu's change of course demonstrates, Israel's policy shift was counterproductive. And given Obama's current political trajectory, Israel will be best served by a return to the government's initial policy. Rather than seeking to placate Obama, Israel should try to wait him out. And at the same time, the government should robustly advance Israel's national interests, both by unapologetically defending those interests in the diplomatic arena, and more importantly by adopting policies and taking action to secure and strengthen the country. The political winds in America are blowing against Obama. Even with his relatively free hand in foreign affairs, the ill winds will necessarily slow him down. Israel should do nothing to smooth his path forward. caroline@carolineglick.com"
240,The Jerusalem Post,2010-01-27,EU unlikely to form cohesive policy on prosecuting Israelis for alleged war crimes,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,NEWS; Pg. 6,"January 31, 2010",615 words,"BRUSSELS - The European Union is unlikely to issue a formal or cohesive policy regarding war crimes allegations leveled against Israeli politicians and army officers for their roles in last year's Gaza conflict, experts from the Brussels-based European Policy Center told The Jerusalem Post last week. Rosa Balfour, senior policy analyst at the think tank, said that despite legal proceedings in a handful of member countries against Israeli officials, differing foreign policies among the 27 EU states means that a formal declaration on the issue or serious sanctions will probably never materialize. According to Balfour, the only restriction currently being imposed on Israel is a ""hold"" on its elevated partnership status with EU, an upgrade that was agreed upon 10 years ago. This freeze, however, which is due to EU disapproval of settlement construction in the West Bank, has had little impact on Israel's trade with the EU, which currently accounts for 50 percent of the Jewish state's exports. Imposing restrictions such as freezing financial assets or suspending trade agreements is a common practice by the EU against partner nations that refuse to comply with certain policies or directives. A case in point is Serbia, which refused to hand over its alleged war criminals following the conflict with neighboring states in the early 1990s, said Balfour, an expert on EU foreign policy. ""Each EU country deals with conflict in its own way and there can be no common foreign policy on this matter,"" she said. In any case, the EU has very little political power but is rather more of an aid and trade instrument for nearby nations. Even the entry to office on December 1 of Catherine Ashton as the first high representative of the EU for foreign affairs and security policy - a post created under the Lisbon Treaty that took effect that day and is meant to give the union a more defined foreign policy - is not likely to persuade member states to act in a cohesive manner, especially on controversial issues such as the Arab-Israeli conflict, Balfour said. ""The EU could leverage more power in these matters but it doesn't,"" observed Balfour, adding that each country has its own interests in maintaining a certain type of relationship in the Middle East. Balfour's comments, however, came less than a week after a delegation of high ranking European parliamentary officials visited the Gaza Strip and urged that some Israeli officials be tried as war criminals. The delegation, headed by British Labor Party legislator Sir Gerald Kaufman, included some 60 EU parliamentarians, representative of 12 countries. Kaufman and his colleagues called for the prosecution of Israeli officials accused of authorizing the use of white phosphorus bombs against civilians during the Gaza conflict of December 2008-January 2009. This delegation follows the September 2009 report of a UN fact-finding team headed by South African Judge Richard Goldstone, which accused the IDF of war crimes against the Palestinians. In addition, last month Kadima chairwoman and former foreign minister Tzipi Livni was forced to cancel a trip to London after Palestinian activists persuaded a court to issue an arrest warrant for her role in the Gaza offensive. Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Maj.-Gen. (res.) Doron Almog have found themselves in similar positions. Israel's relationship with the EU falls mainly under its Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, a consortium of 17 countries based mainly in the Middle East, including Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Libya. Aid and trade agreements between Israel and the EU come via the European Neighborhood Policy, which aims to develop relationships with countries that border Europe."
241,The Jerusalem Post,2010-03-05,Biden's lost cause,,,Newspaper,HIGHLIGHT: COLUMN ONE,,ENGLISH,OPINION; Pg. 24,"March 9, 2010",1813 words,"US Vice President Joseph Biden's job is about to stop being easy. Indeed, it is about to become impossible. On Monday, he will arrive in Israel for a three-day visit. Biden, who will meet with Israel's leaders, will be the most senior official in the cavalcade of senior US officials who have descended on Israel in recent weeks. He will replace Sen. John Kerry, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who was here this week. Kerry himself replaced Adm. Michael Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was here two weeks ago. In his press conference in Jerusalem on Monday, Kerry explained the purpose of these visits. ""...I am here and other people were here and Vice President Biden is coming shortly... to make sure we are all on the same page and that we are all clear about [Iran]."" Although Biden is just the latest senior US official to visit Israel to try to coerce the government not to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power, his visit is novel in one respect. In addition to his meetings with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and the rest of Israel's senior officials, Biden intends to make a case for the Obama administration's policies towards Iran, the Palestinians and Israel directly to the Israeli public. During his trip he will give what is being billed as a major policy speech at Tel Aviv University. In light of the gaping disparity between the Obama administration's policies and those of the Israeli government, the apparent goal of Biden's address is to shore up the position of the Israeli Left as an alternative to Netanyahu. Apparently, the picture emerging from all of the senior US officials' meetings with Netanyahu is that Israel's leader still feels comfortable defying them. Presumably, they now believe that the only way to force him to toe their line is by making him believe that the price of defiance will be his premiership. This of course is a difficult task. The Left after all was roundly defeated in last year's election. Making it a credible alternative is no mean task. The Israeli Left for its part is doing its best to tie its own fortunes to the administration. Opposition leader Tzipi Livni placed herself squarely in the Obama camp this week during her confrontation with Netanyahu at the Knesset. Belittling the results of last month's Gallup poll that showed that Israel enjoys the support of two-thirds of Americans, (and 80 percent of Republicans vs 53% of Democrats), Livni blamed the premier for Israel's international standing. By not bowing to Obama's demands and ending all Jewish construction in Jerusalem and accepting the radical peace proposals she and former prime minister Ehud Olmert made to the Palestinians during their tenure in office, Livni claimed that Netanyahu is ruining Israel's diplomatic position in the US and throughout the world. There is nothing new or surprising about Livni's use of the Obama administration's animosity towards the government as a means of positioning herself as an alternative to the government. And on the surface it makes sense for her to use it. After all, it was by building a partnership with the Clinton administration against Netanyahu the last time he was in power that the Israeli Left was able to bring down his government and win the 1999 election. The Left's hope of forming a coalition with Obama against Netanyahu was given its most explicit expression last July in an op-ed by Haaretz's editor-at-large Aluf Benn in The New York Times. After expressing his support for Obama's policies, Benn bemoaned the fact that due to Obama's low approval ratings among Israeli Jews (at the time they stood at 6% and they later plunged to 4%), it would be hard for him to convince the Israeli public to abandon its support for Netanyahu in favor of Obama's - that is the Israeli Left's - policies. To improve this dismal state of affairs, Benn suggested that Obama simply needs to make his case to the Israeli public, which ""will surely listen"" to him. As far as Benn and his fellow leftists were concerned, Obama's credibility problems redounded not to his policies, which the Left supports. Instead they owed to his failure to dazzle the Israeli people with the same rhetorical magic he used on the Arabs and the Europeans. It was Obama's tone, not his programs, that needed to be improved. In arguing thus, Benn and Livni, and their colleagues on the Left, are acting on their memories of their glory days with the Clinton administration. As president, Bill Clinton was able to simultaneously embrace Yassir Arafat, and take down Netanyahu without anyone ever questioning his undying love for Israel and the Jews. And because of this, he became the hero of the Israeli Left that he swept back into power in 1999. As the Left sees it, Clinton retained his reputation as the greatest friend Israel ever had in the White House, despite the fact that his policies were the most hostile policies the US had ever adopted towards Israel, because he knew how to charm the Israeli electorate. His frequent visits to Israel and his saccharine, lip-biting declarations of love for Yitzhak Rabin and Israel were all it took in their view to convince the public to reject the Right. If Obama would just repeat Clinton's practices, he, too, could bring down Netanyahu and convince the Israeli public to trust him. When Benn's article was published his recommendation was shrugged off by the administration. So, too, the White House rejected repeated requests from the local media for interviews with the president. Now, however, with Obama's US approval rates slipping and his Iran policy in tatters, the White House apparently decided that it needs to embark on a charm offensive in Israel to make Netanyahu more vulnerable to coercion. Biden was selected for the job because he is widely perceived as the most pro-Israel senior member of the administration. The fact that before becoming vice president Biden had one of the most pro-Iran voting records in the Senate has done nothing to mitigate this perception. Indeed, despite the fact that Biden voted repeatedly against sanctions on Iran, claimed that Iran's quest for nuclear bombs was understandable and called for the US to sign a nonaggression pact with the mullocracy while threatening to move for president George W. Bush's impeachment if he were to order a military strike against Iran's nuclear weapons programs, Biden continues to be viewed as a solid supporter of Israel. And indeed, in line with this perception, he can be expected to declare his undying love for the Jewish state several times during his speech at Tel Aviv University. Yet still, and sadly for the Israeli Left and for the Obama administration, his charm offensive will fail to get the girl. The most his visit is likely to yield is a momentary rise in support among Israelis that will quickly recede. And there are four reasons this is the case. First, Obama himself is far weaker than Clinton was. His obsequious attempts to curry favor with the Arabs and Iran have been even more disturbing to Israelis than his refusal to visit the country. Moreover, unlike Clinton, who was popular with Israelis even before he was elected, Obama has never been popular in Israel. Part of this can perhaps be chalked up to timing. Clinton of course succeeded George H.W. Bush, who was deeply unpopular in Israel. Obama replaced his son - who was regarded as a great friend of Israel. Given Obama's weakness, it is hard to see how he can convince the Israeli public that he will be capable of protecting the country from a nuclear-armed Iran or that he can force the Palestinians and the Syrians to end their support of terror in the event of an Israeli withdrawal from Judea and Samaria or the Golan Heights. Second, the Netanyahu Obama faces is not the Netanyahu Clinton faced in the 1990s. Today, the premier leads a far broader coalition than he did in his previous government. It is also more stable. Labor Party chief Defense Minister Ehud Barak knows he cannot unseat Netanyahu. Indeed, he knows he can't even trust his party to continue supporting him if he leaves Netanyahu's government. As for opposition leader Tzipi Livni, the latest polls show her trailing far behind Netanyahu as the people's choice for prime minister. Her party's popularity rates are decreasing, Likud's are growing. Third, there is the fact that today the Left does not control public opinion to the degree it did the last time Netanyahu was in power. During his first government, due in large part to the media's delegitimization of the Right in the wake of Rabin's assassination, the media was able to market the PLO as a credible peace partner. Yasser Arafat himself was portrayed by a popular television show as a sweet, peace loving sock puppet who only wanted to make peace with the craven, war mongering Netanyahu. Consequently it became socially unacceptable in polite circles for Israelis to admit that Arafat and the Palestinians were less than devoted to the notion of peaceful coexistence with Israel or that Netanyahu was right not to give up the store. So, too, it was socially unacceptable in certain quarters to criticize Clinton, who presented himself as Rabin's greatest friend. Today, people are far less embarrassed to make these claims. This is the case, of course, for the fourth reason that Biden will fail in his mission. In the 11 years since Netanyahu was forced from office, the Left's political platform has been discredited by events. Since 1999 the Palestinians - as well as the Lebanese - have demonstrated that the Left's appeasement policies are disastrous. The 1,500 Israelis who have been killed since then by the Palestinians and Hizbullah, the transformation of post- Israeli-withdrawal southern Lebanon and Gaza into jihadist enclaves, the rise of Iran, and Fatah's open rejection of Israel's right to exist have all made the Left's policies unacceptable to a wide majority of Israelis. The public's rejection of the Left's policies is so overwhelming that it has even rejected the Left's current central claim - namely that Israel will lose its Jewish majority if it abstains from surrendering Judea and Samaria. By a 53-28% margin, a Haaretz poll last month showed that Israelis do not believe that Israel's continued presence in the areas will lead to its destruction as a Jewish state. What all of this shows of course is that it will take much more than a change in tone for the Obama administration to win over the Israeli public. Indeed, Obama's open hostility towards Netanyahu has probably been a significant factor in shoring up the public's approval of his performance in office. The Israeli public is not interested in a change of tone - from Obama or from the Israeli Left. It is interested in a change of policy. Until it gets it, the public will in all likelihood remain loyal to Netanyahu. caroline@carolineglick.com"
242,The Jerusalem Post,2010-04-19,No longer tough enough?,,,Newspaper,"HIGHLIGHT: For years we spoke of the timid and unreliable Europeans. Now, in many respects, they are bolder and braver than the US. THE REGION. The writer is director of the Global Research in International Affairs Center and editor of Middle East Review of International Affairs and Turkish Studies. His personal blog can be read at www.rubinreports.blogspot.com",,ENGLISH,OPINION; Pg. 15,"April 22, 2010",857 words,"The US Congress is back as a factor in US foreign policy. Partly because the Obama administration has pushed it too far to do unpopular things, partly because members are no longer in awe of the president's alleged invincibility and popularity. Many Democratic members see their whole careers flashing before their eyes. And, of course, there's the administration's decision to pick a fight with Israel. For the first time since Barack Obama took office, we're seeing a bit of a congressional revolt even from his own side of the aisle. The two issues are Israel and Iran. On Israel, 76 senators - including 38 of 59 Democrats - signed a flattering but critical letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urging reconciliation with Israel. Another 333 House members signed up, including leading Democrats. The letters blamed the Palestinian leadership - and rightly so - for the lack of serious negotiations. They noted that ""it is the very strength of our relationship [with Israel] that has made Arab-Israeli peace agreements possible, both because it convinced those who desired Israel's destruction to abandon any such hope and because it gave successive Israeli governments the confidence to take calculated risks for peace."" On Iran, a whopping 363 members of the House of Representatives urged Obama to put ""crippling"" sanctions on Iran, taking ""tough and decisive measures,"" and urging him to make sure Teheran doesn't get nuclear weapons. Thus, Congress is challenging Obama's policy on four levels: 1. It's not tough enough. 2. The proposed sanctions are too toothless (and on this one, see below). 3. Sanctions have taken too long. 4. Instead of waiting for the UN, the US government should show leadership and act on its own along with willing allies. Moreover, even while the House passed a sanctions measure by a huge majority in December and a similar bill went through the Senate in January, to my knowledge the administration has never taken any position on the proposal. And now things are about to get worse. SECRETARY OF Defense Robert Gates admitted that the US government is ready to water down the sanctions even further to get a UN Security Council resolution supporting additional action against Iran. The rationale for this is to say that this consensus can then be used as a basis for additional sanctions by countries acting on their own, what Gates called, ""a new legal platform."" He explained, ""What is important about the UN resolution is less the specific content of the resolution than the isolation of Iran by the rest of the world."" The Los Angeles Times thought this was , at least partly, an excuse for the failure to get more: ""Gates's comments were the clearest sign yet that the administration, facing continuing resistance from other countries to the harshest of the proposed measures, is lowering its sights. US and allied officials have given up on prospects for a ban on petroleum shipments to or from Iran, and some allies have questioned other potential measures."" It could be pointed out that the second Bush administration also settled for lightweight UN resolutions, but it was far more determined to follow up with a tough strategy. Equally, Russia and China can violate stronger sanctions, but they are not likely to respect weaker ones either. The bottom line is that not only can Iran get off easily, but the signal conveyed undermines the hopes for future containment possibilities. Moreover, I think this situation largely reveals a fundamental flaw in the Obama worldview: What should be important is a tough and effective strategy based on strong US leadership which is going to intimidate Iran at least to some extent. Instead, we get the priority on consensus, to avoid any sign of the dreaded ""unilateralism"" or masterful American leadership which horrifies Obama regarding past US policy. This approach is likely to continue after a UN resolution. Far from unleashing an aggressive US strategy against Iran, the follow-up is more likely to be anticlimactic. Consequently, Obama's policy may succeed in passing muster as legalistic while being hailed by the poodle brigade in the media. But it will fail at the ostensible goal of the entire exercise: stopping Iran now or making Teheran act more cautiously in future. A PARALLEL situation is now going on regarding Syria's providing of advanced Scuds to Lebanon. The US State Department's reaction was a joke: We are going to study this! Compare that to the French response: We must update our thinking. For years we spoke of the timid and unreliable Europeans. Now, in many respects, France (along with Germany and the United Kingdom) is bolder and braver than Obama's policy. Mincing no words, the French Foreign Ministry called the Scud transfer ""alarming"" and pointed out that such activity was in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 which ""imposes an embargo on the export of arms to Lebanon, except those authorized by the government of Lebanon or the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon."" And this is the key. What good is it to get a new UN Security Council resolution if the US government won't even enforce the previous ones?"
243,BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-01-04,"Saudi foreign minister says Israel ""spoiled child"" of international community",,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"January 4, 2010",,"Text of report by Saudi-owned leading pan-Arab daily Al-Sharq al-Awsat website on 3 January [Report by Turki al-Suhayl in Riyadh: ""Sa'ud al-Faysal: Israel Is Like a 'Spoiled Child'; It Does What It Wants With Impunity; Stressed Negotiations Under Way To Facilitate Return of Bin-Ladin's Daughter From Iran; Davutoglu Denies He Is Visiting Riyadh To Facilitate Prospective Visit by Khalid Mish'al""] Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal has described Israel as the international community's ""spoiled child"" and that ""it does what it wants without being punished or held accountable."" This scathing criticism by Prince Al-Faysal followed his meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu in Riyadh yesterday. At the same time, he called on the international community and the US Government in particular ""to take a firm stand to put an end to the Israeli policy of settlement construction in the Palestinian territories in general and in Jerusalem in particular."" The Turkish foreign minister affirmed that the views of both Riyadh and Ankara are identical on the Palestinian issue. He is visiting Saudi Arabia to meet with the custodian of the two holy mosques, King Abdallah Bin-Abd-al-Aziz, and to discus with the Saudi officials ways of boosting bilateral relations. The Turkish foreign Minister has denied reports that his current visit to Saudi Arabia is aimed at facilitating a prospective visit that Khalid Mish'al, Hamas Political Bureau chief, is believed to pay to Riyadh. Observers sought to link the Turkish moves towards ending the division between Hamas and Fatah to Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas' latest visit to Saudi Arabia and to his prospective visit to Turkey, as well as to reports on a visit by Mish'al to Riyadh shortly. The Turkish Foreign Ministry, however, ended these speculations by saying: ""No, there is no connection."" He stressed that Ankara and Riyadh seek to push the Palestinians towards ""reconciliation and negotiations to end their division and achieve unity."" During their talks, which the Saudi foreign minister described as ""deep, comprehensive, and constructive,"" both the Turkish and Saudi foreign ministers discussed ""the means that would unite the Palestinian ranks."" Davutoglu said: ""Saudi Arabia and Turkey are interested in ending divisions in the Palestinian ranks."" The Palestinian issue featured prominently in the talks between the Saudi and Turkish foreign ministers. The Saudi foreign minister said: ""The peace process in the Middle East received a considerable portion of the talks, particularly amid the current stalemate and the contradiction between the Israel statements about freezing settlement construction and the reality on the ground, which is witnessing the construction of more settlements, the latest of which in East Jerusalem."" Al-Faysal said that the settlement expansion ""is a source of deep concern and denunciation for us and for the international community alike,"" noting that this policy ""casts doubt on Israel's seriousness about reviving the peace process based on the creation of an independent and viable Palestinian state within the framework of a two-state solution."" Riyadh emphasized that ""a fair, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the conflict must be based on total Israeli withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967, including the Syrian Golan Heights, and the Lebanese Shab'a farms and the village of Al-Ghajar."" Al-Faysal opined that the complex international situation complicates the process of arriving at a solution to the Palestinian issue. In reply to a question on his response to the message that he and his Turkish counterpart would like to address to the Palestinian people to end their plight, Al-Faysal said: ""If a solution was in my hand, I would have solved the problem 40 years ago, but, regrettably, the international situation is complicated."" He added: ""The reason for failure to reach a solution is the distinguished treatment given to Israel. Countries that violate international law face sanctions, except Israel. This state has become like a spoiled child of the international community; it does what it wants with impunity and without being held to account. Until this method of conduct changes, we believe that matters will remain the same."" Al-Faysal pointed out that ""what is required is to put forward a specific proposal that addresses the key issues, namely border, Jerusalem, refugees, and other basic issues. Ideas should be articulated for resolving these issues and the parties concerned should be called to engage in negotiations over them. If they reach a result, that would be fine. If they do not, the issue should be referred to the International Court of Justice."" He added: ""This is the method that is followed in addressing issues that are similar to the Palestinian issue, but, regrettably, this method has not so far been followed. We believe there is still hope."" The Saudi foreign minister emphasized the need for Israel to realize that ""its rejection of peace will not eventually be in its interest and that Israel would be the first to be threatened by the ensuing instability in the Middle East. We are always optimistic and hope for a good outcome. We hope that the international community will realize its responsibility and that leaving matters unsolved will not address the problem. We hope that the international community will take measures that will lead to results."" Criticizing the international community's feebleness in addressing the Palestinian issue, the Saudi foreign minister praised ""the major role Turkey is playing and its positive participation in the efforts to solve the numerous problems in our region, primarily the Palestinian issue and combating terrorism and the deviant ideology plaguing our region, which is aimed at fomenting sedition and ethnic and sectarian strife."" He said that the importance of Turkey's role stems from its being a major Muslim country linked with good relations to the Middle East countries. These relations are characterized by mutual respect, noninterference in domestic affairs, and exertion of efforts within the framework of regional and international legitimacy. This made Turkey an effective and constructive party in the Middle East."" The issue of Iran's nuclear dossier and the situation in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen featured prominently in the talks between Al-Faysal and Davutoglu. The views of Riyadh and Ankara were clear on the importance of endorsing peaceful, diplomatic means in dealing with the Iranian nuclear crisis. At the same time, they stressed that every country has a right to peaceful use of nuclear energy. Al-Faysal said that Riyadh and Ankara are ""in agreement on the right of Iran and the regional countries to possess nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. At the same time, they support the sincere and serious international efforts to solve the Iranian nuclear crisis through dialogue and peaceful means."" He said that Iran's [positive] response to the peace efforts to resolve the issue of its nuclear file ""will defuse the crisis and eliminate the regional and international doubts and fears of Iran's nuclear programme."" He added: ""We believe it is important to focus efforts on keeping the Gulf region and the Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons, and to apply these standards on all regional countries, including Israel."" The Turkish foreign minister stressed that his country is playing a role in mediation efforts to end the Iranian nuclear crisis. He added: ""We have direct contacts with all the parties concerned and there is an opportunity for the diplomatic efforts to find a solution."" Discussing another issue relating to Iran and members of Usamah Bin-Ladin's family currently in Iran, the Saudi foreign minister stressed that negotiations are under way to handle this issue on the same humanitarian level that this issue represents. On the issue of Bin Ladin's daughter, the Saudi foreign minister said: ""Iman Bin Ladin is present at the Saudi Embassy [in Tehran]. We believe that this issue is purely humanitarian, and we are negotiating with the Iranian Government to handle this issue on the same humanitarian level. We will leave the option of departure from Tehran to Bin Ladin's daughter. We do not want to engage in political issues over this matter because we do not want to mar the atmosphere, and perhaps hamper the girl's travel from Tehran."" In reply to a question about what Iran is required to do to improve its relations with the Gulf States, the Saudi foreign minister said that ""nothing special is required from Iran that does not apply to all states. [It is required] to deal [with the Gulf States] on the basis of international law and noninterference in the domestic affairs of others as well as [adhering] to good neighbourliness. This is the nature of normal relations between states. What is required is to develop relations with Iran."" Discussing the Iraqi issue, the Saudi foreign minister expressed his hope that ""the forthcoming elections would fulfil the Iraqi people's aspirations for security, stability, prosperity, and peaceful coexistence among all Iraqi sons of all ethnicities, sects, beliefs, and political stripes, as well as safeguarding Iraq's independence and sovereignty free from foreign interference."" During their talks in Riyadh, Al-Faysal and Davutoglu reviewed the regional situation amid their hopes that ""the Yemeni Government's efforts will succeed in maintaining security and stability throughout Yemen and safeguarding its national unity and regional safety."" It is to be recalled that Saudi Arabia has been engaged in military operations for approximately two months to purge its territories of Huthist infiltrators. The Saudi foreign minister said that calming the current situation in southern Saudi Arabia, where fighting continues with Huthist infiltrators, must be based on deeds, not words. In reply to a question on the Huthist rebel leader's praise for the speech that the Saudi crown prince addressed to the officers of the Saudi armed forces and the extent of Saudi Arabia's preparedness to accept the offer to calm the situation, he said: ""He is required to translate his words into deeds."" The Saudi foreign minister said that he is very pained at the ongoing fighting in Yemen and stressed that Saudi Arabia is in the forefront of counties that insisted and still insists on raising the standard of living in Yemen to that enjoyed by the rest of the countries in the Arabian Peninsula. He said: ""Saudi Arabia was the most advocate of adopting a strong, firm stand by the Gulf Cooperation Council on the issue of developing Yemen and raising the standard of living there to reach the same level as in the countries in the Arabian Peninsula and that Saudi Arabia was implementing a huge programme in this respect. This situation is one of the reasons that cause us great pain. We are pained to see the current fighting in Yemen and the absence of peaceful coexistence among the Yemeni tribes. This situation will dissipate resources and waste opportunities. The Saudi development programme for Yemen was proceeding well until the war broke out and is now hampering development."" The talks between the Saudi and Turkish foreign ministers also dealt with the Afghan issue. The Saudi foreign minister noted ""the importance of constant endeavours to achieve reconciliation among the various factions of the Afghan people and safeguard their national unity and support their security, stability, and development."" The Turkish foreign minister revealed that his country intends to host meetings on Afghanistan. Riyadh and Ankara seek to promote their relations to a strategic level. Al-Faysal said that the distinguished relations between Saudi Arabia and Turkey ""are based on brotherhood, the same religious faith, and common fate."" He added: ""So it is only natural that our relations will rise to a strategic level. We will promote relations in broader vistas of cooperation in all political, economic, cultural, and social fields in the service of both our countries' common interests and the region's security, stability, and the prosperity of its peoples."" The Saudi and Turkish foreign ministers agreed to review the agreements that have been signed between the two countries to look into ways of activating them. They also agreed to have consular cooperation between the two countries to facilitate mutual investment of both countries' businessmen. They also agreed on consultations between Ankara and Riyadh, and that a programme and timetable will be worked out towards this end. The Saudi foreign minister noted that he discussed with his Turkish counterpart the issue of facilitating the granting of entry visas to government officials and diplomats. He ruled out the possibility of reaching a stage of exemption of entry visas because the system of granting visas in Saudi Arabia differs from the system valid in Turkey, because there are several purposes for granting entry visas to Saudi Arabia, namely visas for work, performing minor pilgrimage, and residence.

Let us see who was meddling with the columnists 10 years ago."" Prime Minister Erdogan said that if necessary the Constitution could be changed in order for ""Democratic Overture"" projects concerning the Kurds, the Alevis and the Romanies to be brought to life. Returning from his trip to Russia, Prime Minister Erdogan chatted with journalists aboard the plane and summed up both domestic and foreign policy developments. Stating that work to abolish visa requirements between both countries may be concluded by the time Medvedev comes to Turkey, Erdogan said that should the problems between Armenia and Azerbaijan be solved this would make it easier to normalize Turkish-Armenian relations. Prime Minister Erdogan hinted that referenda might be held from time to time after the law is changed to shorten the preparation period for referenda. Commenting on opposition criticism of ""civilian fascism"" Erdogan said: ""They are saying that the AKP's vote has dropped to 26 per cent. So, why are you crying?

[Erdogan] If this is really the case and the AKP vote has fallen to 26 per cent then Baykal and his friends should be dancing with joy, yet they are talking about a civilian dictatorship. If our vote falls to 26 or below then the CHP [Republican People's Party] and MHP [Nationalist Action Party] combined vote will be in the 40s. If that is the case then why are you crying? There is a month-and-a-half to go before the next general election. You will increase your vote further. The people will elect you. You will come to power if the nation puts you there. But you will get nowhere by making slander. We went from censorship to democracy If the standard of democracy has increased it is all thanks to the AKP. Many things that could not be talked about before have become discussable under the AKP. Let us look back seven, eight, 10 years. Let us see who was meddling with the columnists back then. We cannot simply ignore the period of emergency rule. Look how far we have come. Did the overture exist before? We know how our citizens in the southeast gained many of their acquis. The Romanies were never on anybody's agenda. When we turned our attention on them the MHP started to make preparations. Hello! Did the Romanies not exist until yesterday? I never saw any overture because of the ""Kurdish problem"" made before. I spoke in Diyarbakir in 2005. The national unity and fraternity project includes minorities, Alevis and Romanies. Our colleagues have all but finalized the legal arrangements shortening the period before a referendum. We should be able to make these kinds of arrangements faster than 120 days. It is hard to hold a referendum here. In the past very few referenda were held. The first one was when Ozal was in power. Turkey should get used to referenda. We shall seek consensus for constitution [Comert] Is a constitutional amendment in the pipeline? [Erdogan] Political parties are obliged to make changes to the law and the Constitution. It goes without saying that Turkey needs to change the Constitution. The conditions are not right for making such detailed changes. We began work on this back in 2007. It got held up by the 14 March process. We pressed ahead with our work. It would be wrong for me to say that such and such a step will be taken. There are preparations underway. Society demands it, and if a consensus is reached in Parliament then we shall move forward. We are not boasting that there will be 100 per cent consensus. We will work hard for a consensus. If somebody takes a step for consensus then so shall we. Earlier on we said let us form a consensus commission for constitutional changes. The CHP did not join it. Narrow scope changes Any change to the Constitution will be narrow in scope. It will not be broad. It will not be a package that ties up Parliament for days. Even the simplest of changes can put wheel-clamps on work. We can do constitutional changes that have a small number of articles. Changes to the political parties and elections laws require a consensus. New gas price deal [Comert] There was a formula keeping our purchase price for Blue Stream gas high. Has any progress been made? [Erdogan] We pressured the Russians as much as we could. They are saying that they can ""reevaluate the situation by 10 November."" A new deal can be made regarding natural gas. Right now it is all up in the air. Turkey made visa proposal [Comert] Scrapping visa requirements between Russia and Turkey was this visit's surprise. How did that happen? [Erdogan] Mr Medvedev and Mr Putin welcomed the abolition of visas. They said, ""Let us start working on that."" It was already on our agenda. Our businessmen have expectations. Medvedev will be visiting Turkey in May or June. We also suggested that the Turkish-Russian Business Council meet in Istanbul. ""Let us top that off with the visa thing,"" we said. It was us who proposed scrapping visas. They regarded it positively. Armenia must withdraw [Comert] Putin maintained that the Karbakh problem must be treated separately from the normalizing of Turkish-Armenian relations. What do you make of his approach? [Erdogan] No matter how much we try to keep them separate, behind the scenes they are connected. The doors closed when the problems between Azerbaijan and Armenia began. You know the business about what the law brings in the law can also send away, right? That is how it is here. There has to be peace in order for such a step to be taken. The problems between Azerbaijan and Armenia should go away. The occupation of Karabakh should end. The Turkey-Armenia issue will be worked out easily. If Armenia really has good intentions then it can start by withdrawing from that region. BDP members must be more prudent [Comert] What do you make of the policy line to be followed by the BDP [Peace and Democracy Party] that replaced the DTP [Democratic Society Party]? [Erdogan] It is our wish that they engage in politics under this roof with diligence and prudence within a democratic parliamentary system without making the same mistakes. There are serious democratic rights under this roof. That rostrum grants so many opportunities. They said so much from there. Different words said in different locations had undesirable consequences. I have said it before, we are opposed to dissolving legal identities. If an individual commits a crime they should pay the price. As for Baydemir... First he spat venom then the next day he retracted. Not elegant but unseemly. I will not tell mayors that they are not politicians. Politicians must know very well what they are saying. The AKP does have projects in that region. There are investments that have not been made in 80 years. It is unseemly to ignore all that. International formula for nuclear power station [Comert] A formula for ""an international deal"" with respect to a nuclear power station was on the agenda. How is this process going to end? [Erdogan] The Council of State annulled the tender. We started a new process. It is continuing. Work is being done. How is a deal made between governments? The technical details are being worked on. Once they are in place then we shall all meet up. Afterwards, all the prime ministers will send the project to Parliament. It will be treated as an international agreement. The Council of State will not be involved. There are previous examples of this. It could take six months. Siemens is Russia's preferred partner. We are talking about two units of about 2,400-2,500 megawatts. The process will take up to seven years. Preparations are in place for Sinop. We shall pursue the same method here. We shall fix this using an intergovernmental agreement. I was right when I said ""it missed us"" [Comert] What do you make of the economic crisis as it stands right now? You had said that the crisis had ""missed"" Turkey. [Erdogan] Our finance sector was not affected by the crisis. In terms of unemployment figures, we were also the least hard hit. Unemployment was at 10.7 per cent when we came to office. The economic indicators began to rise in 2010. We shall see this when the figures for the last quarter are released. Our growth estimates for 2010 are modest. We are saying 3.5 per cent, but I believe it will be higher. I told Putin take the initiative For us the step to be taken is obvious. There are corridors in front of us. We took certain risks. We began with cargo flights between Istanbul and Yerevan. We have opened the air corridor but the land corridor is a different matter. There are currently many Armenians in Turkey who are not citizens. Russia should take the initiative. I spoke bluntly with Putin and Medvedev. Of the Minsk Three, the country with the most influence over Armenia is Russia, then the United States and then France. We switched to strategic cooperation with Russia [Comert] Can we assume that Turkish-Russian relations have entered a new era with this visit? [Erdogan] We first called our relations with Russia ""a union of forces between governments."" We then switched to intergovernmental cooperation. We are now at the level of strategic cooperation. We expect to sign a ""strategic cooperation agreement"" when Medvedev comes here. Just like with Syria and Iraq. Russia has made similar deals with France and Germany. It will do this also with Turkey. The energy business will change the fate of many things. We need to bring this to life quickly. Source: Yeni Safak website, Istanbul, in Turkish 15 Jan 10"

Hence, he cannot understand the reason why the US administration should object to Iraq barring confirmed Ba'thists from sneaking back to positions of power despite the high price in human blood and material resources paid by this very administration to topple the ""criminal Ba'thist regime"" in Iraq. He wishes the US administration would quit using such double standards because, if it doesn't, the staggering price it has paid and the enormous sacrifices Iraqis have made so that Iraq may be put on track to democracy will have gone to waste.

Column by Abd al-Hadi Mahdi titled ""The politician, between violating the constitution and abiding by it: Al-Ani as model"": The writer lashes out at legislator Zafir al-Ani for accusing President Talabani of not catering for the interests of all Iraqis and for demanding that he should not seek a second presidential term. He reminds Al-Ani of the nationally and internationally acknowledged pacifist role played by President Talabani, who has been described as the ultimate Iraqi safety valve for his mellow wisdom and exquisite political ability to bring rival factions together to settle their differences peacefully in the best interests of the Iraqi nation. He also draws attention to the fact that President Talabani has not ascended to his position as a result of a military coup, as is the case in many of the countries Al-Ani usually relies on for political support, but was elected to it because of his distinguished statesmanship. Noting that Al-Ani has already begun backtracking on his rash statements, the writer calls on him to admit his grave mistake and apologize for it while he still has the chance to do so.

246,BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-02-27,"Al-Jazeera TV reports on Iraqi elections, Christian minority, Arab role",,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"February 27, 2010",,"Doha Al-Jazeera Satellite Channel Television in Arabic between 1430 gmt and 2100 gmt on 26 February is observed to carry several reports on the Iraqi parliamentary elections, scheduled to take place on 7 March. The channel dedicates a 30-minute daily programme to reports on the Iraqi elections, as well as interviewing writers and political analysts. Clinton's Remarks on Elections At 1430 gmt, the channel carries the following announcer-read report: ""US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has accused Iran of trying to alter the results of the Iraqi elections, slated for 7 March. Clinton said before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that neighbouring countries other than Iran are trying to interfere in the Iraqi elections, but made no mention of any of these countries. Clinton stated that the Iranian role in Iraq is the main source of concern and that the United States spares no effort to ensure a high turnout in the Iraqi elections, thus diminishing the Iranian interference, which she said is rejected by the Iraqis."" Role of Arab Countries in Iraqi Elections At 1432 gmt, the channel carries the following announcer-read report: ""The highlighting of the Arab identity of Iraq and its affiliation with the Arab world figures highly in the campaigns of some Iraqi lists participating in the elections. The visits made by leaders of the Iraqi list to Arab countries have caused dispute among political blocs over the motives behind these visits."" Immediately afterward, the channel carries a three-minute video report by Hamid Hadid, who says: ""The competing Iraqi politicians have spared no efforts to use all statements and visits by others in their election campaigns."" The channel highlights visits by Iyad Allawi to Saudi Arabia and by Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi to Egypt and his meeting with the Egyptian president. The report notes some Iraqi politicians' rejection of these visits. At 1435 gmt, the channel conducts a four-minute live satellite interview with Iraqi journalist Ali al-Kalidar, from Cairo. Asked if Iraq maintains weak relations with Arab countries, Al-Kalidar responds by saying: ""It is natural that Arabs are trying, even if they are late, to establish relations either with the Iraqi people or with the current regime."" Asked why some think that the Iraqi officials' visits to Arab states were made to serve election goals, Al-Kalidar says: ""The recent visits before the elections will not yield anything. Had there been any arrangements, coordination would have begun earlier."" He adds: ""I do not believe the Arab courtiers play significant roles in the Iraqi arena and their influences are limited, contrary to the Iranian and US roles, as well as the limited Turkish role. However, the Iranian influence is the biggest in Iraq, and I do not exaggerate if I say that the Iranian role now is more influential than the US role."" Christian Minority in Iraq At 1441 gmt, Yusuf III, patriarch of the Antioch Syriac Catholic Church in Iraq, has called on Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to combat with an iron fist the acts of murder that Christians are facing in the city of Mosul. Iraqi MPs said that there are political motives behind the attacks on Christians in the Ninawa Governorate, and that the issue of minorities is utilized in support of one side against another in the upcoming elections."" Immediately afterward, the channel interviews (?Khoshaba Solaqa), spokesman for the Democratic Assyrians Movement, from Baghdad. Asked to comment on the increase in attacks on Christians in the city of Mosul, Solaqa responds by saying that the killing of Christians in the city of Mosul is ""organized, directed, and funded by political entities that have political goals behind these killings."" Solaqa adds: ""The killing of Christians is part of the power struggle among different political sides."" Asked how attacks on Christians can support one side against another in the elections, Solaqa says: ""Such an approach will put pressure on the Christians in Mosul into migrating to safer places. When a referendum is held to determine whether or not these areas will join the Kurdistan region, Christians will vote for the side that provides them with security and safety."" He adds that the attacks on the Christians occur whenever there are political developments. INA Calls on Electoral Commission To Provide Clarifications on Elections At 1615 gmt, the channel carries the following announcer-read report: ""The Iraqi National Alliance [INA] has called on the Electoral Commission to hold a public meeting and allow all political powers to participate in the meeting in order to give clarifications on the election process. The alliance, after its leaders held an urgent meeting, said that it has concerns regarding the skewing of the results of the coming legislative elections and regarding the interference of some UN employees. The alliance dismissed as baseless what Iraqi Parliament Speaker Iyad al-Samarra'i said that there is an agreement between former Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and the Iraqi National Alliance, with Iranian blessing, to appoint Allawi as the next prime minister."" Reinstatement of Former Iraqi Army Officers At 2045 gmt, the channel carries the following announcer-read report: ""Muhammad al-Askari, spokesman for the Iraqi Defence Ministry, said that Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki agreed to reinstate around 20,000 army officers who were released following the occupation of Iraq in 2003. Al-Askari added that this step has nothing to do with election campaigns, but that the required funds have become available at this point in time. Maysun al-Damluji, MP for the Iraqi list, said that this step is related to the elections and aims to garner votes ahead of the upcoming elections."" Immediately afterward, the channel conducts a live satellite interview with writer and political analyst Ali Yunis, from Washington. Asked how the United States views Al-Maliki's steps, Yunis says: ""I think Washington agrees with and encourages such steps,"" adding that the US policy ""encourages ending the issue of de-Ba'thification and incorporating members of the former Iraqi Army into the army.""

247,BBC Monitoring Europe - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-03-09,"Czech foreign minister interviewed on Russia, Afghanistan, Iran, Kosovo, trade",,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"March 9, 2010",,"Text of report by Czech privately-owned independent centre-left newspaper Pravo website, on 27 February [Interview with Foreign Minister Jan Kohout by Jiri Ovcacek; place and date not given: ""Kohout: I Am Not Merely Official; I Would Seriously Consider Any Offer To Stand as Candidate for CSSD. It Is Not Possible To Shoot Way to Peace in Afghanistan: Most Important Thing Is Support for Social and Economic Development.""] [Ovcacek] Deputy prime minister, sir, there is talk about your possible candidacy for the CSSD [Czech Social Democratic Party] in the May election to the Chamber of Deputies, in the Plzen constituency. Has anyone talked to you about this? Would you agree to being a candidate? [Kohout] I have not received any offer to be on the CSSD ballot list. No one has contacted me. However, I can say clearly that, if some such offer was to be made, then I would think about it very seriously. I base my approach on the consideration that such a step requires stepping over a certain boundary between an official and a politician. In my case this already occurred in 2005, when for a while I was a candidate for prime minister. And then of course it happened again during my current engagement as foreign affairs minister. [Ovcacek] If, then, you were to receive an offer to run as a candidate in the election and you were to think about it seriously, then would you prefer to stand in Plzen region? [Kohout] This is of course speculation because no such thing has happened. However, evidently this speculation is based on the fact that I was born in the Plzen region and I have friends and family there, whom I often visit. This would certainly suit me. [Ovcacek] Before you became a minister in Jan Fischer's government, you suspended your membership in the CSSD. After the election or if you run as a candidate, are you going to rejoin the party? [Kohout] I have never said that I am leaving the CSSD, but for the purpose of my presence in this government I have merely suspended my membership. I am prepared in any kind of circumstances, even without any candidacy or anything else whatsoever, to renew my membership. [Ovcacek] Let us leave the topic of your candidacy to the Chamber of Deputies. Do you already have some idea of what you are going to do after the May election? Would you like to remain in the post of foreign minister, or are you also deliberating about some other career, for instance within this ministry? [Kohout] I have always said that I would like to remain in diplomacy, in foreign policy. This is the thing that I know best - whether this is European issues or more global, world, issues. I definitely see my further role somewhere close to, or directly in the heart of, diplomacy. [Ovcacek] I have heard that you would apparently like to take up a post at some embassy, that you are considering this. [Kohout] This is a quite realistic variant - that I would continue as ambassador in some significant country. [Ovcacek] And if I ask about the United States... [Kohout] This is definitely one of the most significant countries, if not the most significant of all. I think that this is a challenge for every person, a great opportunity to achieve something. [Ovcacek] CSSD Chairman Jiri Paroubek has asked Prime Minister Fischer whether ministers nominated for the Social Democrats could be allowed to take part in meetings of the party leadership. Are you prepared to attend meetings of the CSSD party board? [Kohout] I am prepared and I have even promised that I am going to attend the remaining meetings of the party board, if I am here and if my work duties do not take me somewhere outside the Czech Republic. [Ovcacek] Have you asked the prime minister whether you can take part in the sessions of the CSSD leadership? [Kohout] I have not yet been able to do this, because I have not seen the prime minister since that time. We have only spoken together by telephone. However, I have I have been informed by other people that he is not against this. [Ovcacek] In 2008 the Social Democrats did not vote for Vaclav Klaus's re-election as president. You were nominated to the government by the CSSD. What relations exactly do you have with the president? [Kohout] I would characterize these relations as very good, as very practical working ones. We often consult together. [Ovcacek] In your opinion, was it a good thing that Vaclav Klaus became president again two years ago? [Kohout] I think that he is a very good president for the Czech Republic. And this is true both at home and also in his representation of the country abroad. [Ovcacek] Petr Kolar is supposed to become the new ambassador in Russia. He is moving from the United States. Are you not afraid that the Russians could express dissatisfaction towards him? [Kohout] The rule applies that, if you do not get agreement with an ambassador's arrival from the country to which he is going, then there is no talk about the person becoming ambassador. I am going to speak very generally and in an absolutely unspecific way, and by this I do not want in any way to confirm whether Mr Kolar is, or is not, going to become ambassador, because this would be counter to diplomatic custom. However, in general I can say two things. Mr Petr Kolar, whose name you have already mentioned, is a very high quality diplomat, and I would say that he is one of the best Czech diplomats in all aspects. And regarding his possibly taking up this post: I think that for every country, including even the Russian Federation, it is certainly a plus point that a diplomat coming to the country in question has served previously in Washington - and that the incoming person is not, for instance, some ""no name"" [in English in original] about whom no one knows anything and who does not have any period of service behind him or her. It can be said that the path to Moscow leads through Washington, if I am to flatter a little. [Ovcacek] Do you already know who is going to take over from Jaroslav Basta as the new Czech ambassador in Ukraine? [Kohout] Absolutely sincerely at this moment we do not have any name; we are in the process of selecting someone. We have several candidates, several people tipped for the post, but so far the government and the ministry have not narrowed this down to one name. [Ovcacek] As far as Russia itself is concerned, is it a bogeyman for the Czech Republic, or is it an opportunity for cooperation, primarily economic? Do you see any threat towards the Czech Republic from Russia? [Kohout] For us Russia is primarily a large and important partner with which we want to have proper and respected relations. Nevertheless, I would not like this effort for correct and proper relations to be perceived by anyone as weakness. On our part it is definitely not a case of weakness. Russia is to a certain extent more assertive than it has been in previous years. At the same time it is clearly aware of the fact that this part of Europe, which is already fully integrated into NATO and the EU, does not want to get into the sphere of influence of any kind of interest as regards its own domestic political scene. Everyone in this region very much appreciates what was achieved 20 years ago - that is, the freedom to decide one's own destiny. We are conducting a dialogue with Russia on the issue of new threats, such as terrorism. Nevertheless, it is necessary to say clearly that, if training exercises take place near NATO or EU borders with scenarios that indicate that this may be a case of some country that is an EU member country in the role of opponent, then naturally this definitely does not contribute to stability and understanding. So, it is not a bogeyman of which we need to be afraid. Fear would be a demonstration of lack of confidence in ourselves. On the other hand, Russia cannot be underestimated, because it has its interests, which are not necessarily always in accord with our interests. At the same time this is a case of a partner that offers enormous opportunities for mutually advantageous trade and investment. [Ovcacek] In 2008 Topolanek's cabinet recognized the independence of Kosovo [Kosova]. If you had been in the government at that time, would you have recommended such a step? [Kohout] This is a very speculative question, because I did not have the possibility of being in this government. This was not a simple situation for anyone in the Czech Republic. The decision was a very close one, and all the pros and cons were considered. In January I was on a visit to Serbia and of course the matter of Kosovo was among the issues we discussed. What is important is that we succeeded in isolating the fact that we inclined towards recognizing Kosovo from our bilateral relations with Serbia. However, to return to your question, most probably after long hesitation and very tough deliberations I would have inclined towards the opinion that in the end prevailed. Probably I would have voted in favour, but with a heavy heart. [Ovcacek] Even though the Czech Government acknowledged Kosovo, the process has actually only been half completed. Because the Czech Republic does not have an ambassador in Prishtina [Pristina] and Kosovo also does not have an ambassador here. Has there been any shift in this matter, or will the situation remain like this for the time being? [Kohout] I do not expect any shift. The fact of recognition has occurred. Diplomatic missions do not always need to be led by someone of the rank of ambassador. I think that our bilateral approach at the level of charge d'affaires is optimal, suitable, and we do not have any need to change it. [Ovcacek] The Chamber of Deputies Defence Committee recommended not increasing the contingent in Afghanistan. At the session of the government you voted in favour, while the CSSD is against. What reasons did you have for voting in favour? [Kohout] I am really convinced that we have two decisive years ahead of us in Afghanistan. On this occasion it is not a case of us wanting to bring about peace by waging war. Rather, as an international community, we have a clear strategy with a clear political aim, which is the return of stability to Afghanistan. It is also a case of reconciling with that part of the Taleban that does not commit terrorist acts. There is a clear political and military strategy here, which requires an increase in forces and funds for a certain restricted period of time. This does not mean that afterward we should all leave en masse. Depending on the level of stability and the ability of the Afghan authorities to take over responsibility themselves for the country's development, we will be enabled to gradually withdraw from Afghanistan - which, I think, is a good strategy. The Defence Ministry prepared a catalogue of all possible contributions, including four T-72 tanks. After a certain debate we came to the conclusion that the core of our help should be primarily in the training of the police, which I regard as the most significant part of our contribution. A second matter is the deployment of ARTHUR artillery detection radar systems. I agreed with this because I think that they are defensive equipment - they are serving to support Afghanistan in being able to stand on its own feet. As far as Arthur is concerned, it is a defensive weapon that prevents victims among the civilian population, because they are intended for precise directing of return fire. [Ovcacek] Are you going to try to negotiate support for an increase in the Czech participation in Afghanistan? [Kohout] I do not want to give up because of the result of the vote in the Chamber of Deputies; negotiations on this are continuing. So far we have the vote of one committee. I am going to try to explain this matter. At the same time I understand that there are certain limits for the CSSD in this matter, given by the November party resolution concerning any increase in our military participation. I perceive this primarily as a resolution that talks about combat activities, not about defensive means. I am going to continue participating in these discussions. I would be glad if a certain shift occurs, because I think that this would be a significant contribution with a real effect within the limits of our possibilities. [Ovcacek] Are you also going to visit the CSSD deputies group and are you going to use the arguments you have just outlined in this interview to try to persuade them? [Kohout] Of course, if there is such an opportunity, I will be very glad to do this. Because I think that the arguments that we have are matter-of-fact and good ones, and at the same time these arguments do not run counter to what the CSSD approved in its party resolution. [Ovcacek] However, objections can be heard from the left-of-centre that in Afghanistan it is primarily a case of a military solution, of an adventure in the interest of a foreign power. [Kohout] Within the ministry and the government we are trying to show clearly that the resolution of the situation in Afghanistan is not military. It is not possible to shoot our way to peace there. The strategy that the government has approved is based on three pillars. As the most important pillar I regard support for the country's social and economic development, primarily through the provincial reconstruction team that we have in Logar. This is also the reason why in the government vote I made my consent with the increase in military police officers and ARTHURs [artillery detection radar systems] conditional on an increase in the funds for the PRT reconstruction team back to the originally intended level. This team is carrying out exceptionally good work; it is internationally acknowledged. The strategy of the entire international community comprises primarily in building up the capacities that will enable the Afghan Government to ensure that the country starts to function. Unfortunately, at the current moment this stabilization and reconstruction is not possible without a military element. However, this element is not primary; it is a case of support for the principal activities. The third pillar consists of trade and business. [Ovcacek] The former Czechoslovakia was one of the significant investors in Afghanistan. Do you think that Czech firms will succeed in breaking into the Afghan market after the country has been stabilized? Or is the Czech Republic going to try to help in Logar, and then big firms from America and other countries are going to come in afterward and brush aside the Czech ones? [Kohout] This second variant is also very realistic. For instance, already at this moment China is very intensively engaged in the area of extraction of minerals. In the case of some businesses in the Czech Republic I see primarily security fears about going into this war-afflicted country. In November I visited Iraq. I was in Baghdad, where the security situation is also very problematic. In spite of this even in such conditions it is possible to find opportunities for business. I assume that on my visit to Afghanistan I am going to take at least some representatives of the Czech business community - those who are sufficiently brave. So that they can try to find some room for themselves. [Ovcacek] Let us move on to another country. What is the Czech Republic's stance on the proposal for tougher sanctions against Iran because of Iran's nuclear programme? [Kohout] The Czech Republic initiated negotiations on possible EU sanctions already during the period of our EU presidency. This does not mean that we are some kind of hawks, because we give precedence to a diplomatic solution, to an agreement concerning uranium enrichment to 20 per cent at the Tehran reactor for the needs primarily of nuclear medicine. On the other hand, we must be aware that Iran has not explained sufficiently to the international community the real essence of its nuclear programme. I think the last report of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] is very alarming. The preparation of so-called clever sanctions is entirely in order: these sanctions would be directed primarily at those who are responsible for this nuclear programme; the sanctions would not hit the population across the board. We also support this process. This is a something that it is necessary to have in hand and in reserve for the eventuality that negotiations do not lead to a positive outcome. [Ovcacek] At a time of crisis Czech companies could be helped by intensive economic diplomacy, something which is now being discussed. Which regions should be targeted? [Kohout] The basis for this is the pro-export strategy that this government would like to approve while still in office. I am working on this together with Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Tosovsky. The specific instruments used and the territories in which we would like this strategy to function will be derived from this strategy. Every region is a little bit different. Western Europe, our biggest business partner, does not require the presence of politicians for negotiating business and trade deals. There are countries to the south and to the east of us, in Asia, in the Arabian world and in Latin America, where the presence of trade councils is of course essential. We have an agreement with the trade minister that he will take a representative of the foreign ministry, mostly at the deputy minister level, on all his trips. This representative will assist the minister in diplomatic and political negotiations. And I have initiated the practice of taking on all my trips business representatives nominated by the Business Chamber and the Federation of Industry and Transportation. These are representatives of companies that are already engaged in the process of negotiating some contracts. We have just been in Syria and Lebanon and I am going to Africa. [Ovcacek] If you are going to strengthen the business and trade sections of embassies in some regions, are you also going to try to attract people with business experience when filling these posts? [Kohout] We have a long-term agreement with the Trade and Industry Ministry that people for these functions are selected by a joint commission. In the majority of cases the people selected are employees of the Industry Ministry. The idea of enabling people who are already in business or who have such business experience to apply as candidates for such posts would be a very desirable one.

248,BBC Monitoring Middle East - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-03-18,Brazil's Lula should take role in Middle East peace process - Israeli daily,,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"March 18, 2010",,"Text of report in English by privately-owned Israeli daily The Jerusalem Post website on 18 March [Commentary by Ely Karmon, a senior research scholar at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism and The Institute for Policy and Strategy at The Interdisciplinary Centre, Herzliyya: ""Could Brazil Be A Player in the Middle East Process?""] President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is the first Brazilian head of state to visit the Holy Land since Emperor Dom Pedro II in 1876, a great event indeed for both Israel and Brazil. He is also visiting the Palestinian [National] Authority and Jordan. Since early 2009, it seems that Brazil, and President da Silva personally, has taken on an active diplomatic offensive in the Middle East, centred around Iran's international position. After a failed attempt at a visit in May, due to elections constraints, Mahmud Ahmadinezhad became the first Iranian president to visit Brazil in November 2009. Despite American, and even internal, criticism concerning Brazil's lenient view on Iran's nuclear programme as well as the disputed presidential elections, da Silva has warmly welcomed Ahmadinezhad, claiming that the two countries can cooperate to enhance a new economic order. In the face of Iran's successful push in Latin America, the Israeli diplomatic corps has finally rediscovered the continent. Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman visited Brazil in July 2009, followed by President Shimon Peres in November, the first visit of an Israeli President in 40 years. Coincidence or not, Palestinian [National] Authority President Mahmud Abbas was also invited in November. It seems therefore that da Silva has taken these opportunities to involve Brazil in the Middle East process and to perhaps act as a mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well as US-Iranian relations. This diplomatic push fits Brazil's enhanced regional and global standing, its membership in the BRIC Club (Brazil, Russia, India and China), its desire for a permanent seat on the Security Council and da Silva's personal ambition to play a more international role. This move was facilitated by US President Barack Obama's new strategy of openness towards Iran and the Muslim world. Da Silva was the first Latin American leader hosted by Obama, who hailed him as ""the most popular politician on earth."" On the other hand, da Silva's relationship with Iran has been described as conflicting with Western policies aimed at isolating and sanctioning Iran for its controversial nuclear project. Brazil has, by and large, supported the Iranian nuclear programme, and the president considers Iran to have the right to develop peaceful nuclear technology, provided that it does not violate international regulations. During the visits of Middle Eastern politicians in Brazil, da Silva has stressed the importance of searching for peace in the region by means of dialogue rather than isolation, and showed his determination to engage in Middle East affairs. ""The time has come to bring into the arena players who will be able to put forward new ideas. Those players must have access to all levels of the conflict: in Israel, in Palestine, in Iran, in Syria, in Jordan and in many other countries that are associated with this conflict"" da Silva told Haaretz just before his arrival. What then are the issues at stake and what are the chances Brazil can play a major role in the negotiating process in the region? Concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mahmud Abbas declared during his visit: ""With respect to you, President Lula, we would like you to have a role (in the Middle East), and you're ready for it. Brazil, as an important country, and President Lula, as a respected leader, can play an important role. There are many ways of taking action for peace."" Interestingly, Abbas's main request to da Silva was to convince Iran to put an end to its support for the radical Palestinian movement Hamas. ""Iran supports Hamas with money and Hamas' decisions are in the hands of Teheran,"" he said in an interview before his arrival. Days ago, Mahmud Abbas blamed Iran for thwarting reconciliation between his Fatah faction and Hamas. Iran doesn't want Hamas to sign the Egyptian-brokered reconciliation document, Abbas said, and argued that the Palestinians should be ""free from Iranian tutelage."" It could inferred from this that Abbas will once again ask President Lula to intervene with the Iranians during his May visit to Teheran. Abbas will also probably prepare the ground for future support from Brazil should negotiations with Israel fail and the Palestinian [National] Authority decides to make a unilateral declaration of Palestinian sovereignty. As for the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, Abbas, the Israeli leaders as well as some sceptic observers, believe that Brazil has a rather ""modest diplomatic realm in the region."" They are betting mainly on US mediation and are already overwhelmed by the meddling of some already major players, like Egypt, Europeans and other well-wishers worldwide. The Israeli government would have most probably insisted in its dialogue with the Brazilian president on a more assertive stance on the Iranian nuclear issue, seen as an existential threat to the Jewish state, especially against the backdrop of Brazil's decision not to support the proposed sanctions against Iran at the Security Council and da Silva's recent declaration that ""there are other interests in the Middle East which must be represented ... Iran is part of all this, and therefore someone must talk to them."" At least on the issue of Ahmadinezhad's Holocaust denial and threats to destroy Israel, da Silva has presented a clear stance: ""It's impossible to imagine someone saying there wasn't a Holocaust or to accept someone saying they're going to do away with another country,"" da Silva said before his departure to the region. It seems Ahmadinezhad hadn't heard Lula; he declared two days later that Israel ""had reached the end of its road"" and was no longer ""useful for its masters (the West)"" who had ""gathered the most criminal people in the world and stationed them in our region with lies and fabricated scenarios."" Thus, ironically, on the political and diplomatic side, da Silva's visit to Israel, the PNA and Jordan will be focused mostly on the Iranian issue. Hopefully, the Brazilian president will understand that his country's stance is extremely important in the global arena, and that he should strive to help stop the nuclearization of the radical Iranian regime: for the sake of the stability of our beleaguered region, the advance of the people process between Israel and the Palestinians, the internal reconciliation between Palestinian themselves and for the well-being of the oppressed Iranian people.

249,BBC Monitoring Former Soviet Union - Political                       Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring,2010-05-22,Russian foreign minister addresses parliament - full text,,,Transcript,,,ENGLISH,,"May 22, 2010",,"Text of report in English by Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website on 21 May Transcript of Remarks by Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov during Government Hour at the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation on Current Issues in Russian Foreign Policy, Moscow, May 19, 2010 Dear Colleagues, First of all I would like to express my gratitude for yet another opportunity to address the State Duma in the Government Hour session on an important question for our interaction. It is formulated as the current moment in international affairs and the tasks of Russian diplomacy. I think that this is as timely as possible the world is at a crossroads, looking for new ways and models of development. International relations have been cardinally transformed and their former adversarial paradigm, which reflected the so-called logic of zero sum game, is receding into the past. The postwar system of global governance, as shown by the current financial and economic crisis, is reaching the limit of its resources. A process of the formation of a polycentric world is unfolding, new centres of power and influence are becoming stronger and the task arises of finding common denominators as a basis for joint action in international affairs. Coming to the fore at present are the challenges common to all: the spread of weapons of mass destruction, international terrorism, organized crime, drug trafficking, global poverty, food shortages, epidemics, climate change, and much more, including, incidentally, the fragility of the environment, which the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico has demonstrated once again. The need to jointly address these issues is evident. But understanding that did not instantly come. It took the experience of several years of fruitless policy of a number of world powers that led all into an impasse. It also took a very powerful reconciliation with reality which the current financial crisis became: it has helped make everyone aware of the truth that security and development are indivisible and can no longer be provided at another's expense. All this dictates a unifying agenda, the need for broad international cooperation, and harmonization of relations among nations based on convergence and interpenetration of economies and cultures. We note the positive elements in the evolution of the international situation. It can be said that the demand for confrontational approaches has declined in Euro-Atlantic politics on the whole. Even those are forced to reckon with this who tried to make political capital on the creation of new dividing lines in Europe. Global processes are generally in line with those assessments which are set out in the Foreign Policy Concept of Russia, approved by President Dmitry Medvedev. The principles of foreign policy declared by us: pragmatism, multi-vector network diplomacy, openness, and a non-confrontational manner to promote national interests are gaining ever wider currency. This philosophy fully retains its relevance in the conditions of the reformulation of the country's interests along the lines of modernization. Our main objective to create favourable external conditions for our internal development remains unchanged. The imperatives of interdependence dictate the need for an active rather than passive view of the external factors of our development. The heightened focus of our foreign policy goals on the modernization tasks is a logical and natural response to the challenges of development that are common to the world's all states without exception. In this case we can't afford to idly wait for the promising trends to lead our country to the result suiting us. In our interpretation of the current stage of world development, we have turned out to be on the crest of change, have received, if you will, some intellectual advantage which, however, loses its significance unless it serves the basis for a proactive line in international affairs. That is why Russia, which does not have much interest in maintaining the status quo, acts vigorously to ensure that in the process of reforming the global architecture whether in security, finance or other areas our national interests are best taken into account. The new international system will inevitably embody the cultural and civilizational diversity of the world. Of course, this is not about the decline of Europe. It's just that the West-centric international order has reached the limit of its resources. For some people in the West this generates fear, but I think it will pass. Leaders of the new Russia have repeatedly stated that democracy, human rights and market economy are a common set of international values. It's another matter President Medvedev also spoke about this that the same tenets of democracy should have a distinct national tinge. This approach provides a realistic basis for cooperation among all states, in order to strengthen confidence in the world and to exclude from the practice of international communication, all attempts to bring everyone into line by imposing on others one's own interpretation of these fundamental values and one's own model of sociopolitical and socioeconomic development. This is especially true now that the crisis and its consequences require a collective reassessment of the experience accumulated by mankind and at issue are the formulation of a new paradigm of economic growth and the creation of its new technological base. The above approaches explain the overall revitalization of Russian foreign policy, which our foreign partners have also noted. In recent years, such important foreign policy actions at the highest level were held as the celebration of the 65th anniversary of the Victory, the summits of the CIS and the CSTO in Moscow, the BRIC summit in Brazil, the Washington nuclear security summit, President Medvedev's meetings with US President Barack Obama and President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych, the Russian President's visit to Slovakia, Argentina, Norway, Denmark, Syria, and Turkey. The President of Brazil has just visited Moscow. In June, the Russian President will participate in the summits of the Group of Eight and the Group of Twenty in Canada. At the G20 meeting it is borne in mind to achieve the implementation of the previous decisions on the reform of the international monetary and financial system. For this purpose it is necessary to institutionalize the G20, and agree on clear rules for its work that would ensure equality of participants. It is essential that all contacts at the highest level are yielding tangible results. On April 8 a new treaty on strategic offensive arms was signed in Prague, which fully meets the interests of the Russian Federation, providing on a parity basis compliance with the fundamental principle of equal and indivisible security. We agreed with the US on significant reductions in strategic offensive arms, and developed a simplified and less costly mechanism for monitoring and transparency of the process. The Treaty aims at strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime and at raising the level of trust between nuclear and nonnuclear members of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The most important part of the package of agreements reached is that the treaty can operate and be viable only in the absence of qualitative and quantitative capacity building for US missile defence systems that would jeopardize the potential of the strategic nuclear forces of the Russian Federation. We hope in this regard for support from the State Duma deputies during the upcoming hearings on this important international document. Of course, the Russian-American agenda is not confined to security issues. It also includes a joint search for answers to modern challenges, assistance to the settlement of regional conflicts, improvements in the mechanism of multilateral regulation of international relations, and much more. But we pay special attention to the stimulation of economic, trade and investment cooperation, and the realization of joint projects in the field of innovation and high technology. A new impetus in this direction should be given by the upcoming visit of President Medvedev to the US. In this case we will continue to proceed from the assumption that relations between Russia and the United States must be mutually beneficial and equitable. We cannot accept a different vision of the partnership. In today's world there is a tendency to strengthen regional and sub regional levels of government. For Russia this trend manifests itself, above all, in the consolidation of integration processes in the CIS. All countries of the Commonwealth, as you know, spoke with one voice in the assessment of the historical significance of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War. This is the most important political document, which cements our consolidated position. It is also pertinent to note the following: recent developments such as the Caucasian crisis, the election in Ukraine, the situation in Kyrgyzstan have shown that attempts at outside interference in the processes of internal development, and experimentation in the field of social engineering in line with the infamous logic of zero-sum games give the opposite effect, leading to destabilization and eventually throwing the countries back in their development. No positive processes could develop in the absence of internal stability. I would like the understanding of this to become a principled basis for activities in this region of the so called external factors, whether the European Union, NATO or any other structures and individual states. The modernization imperatives common to the CIS countries assert themselves more and more loudly. In this case all that unites us, and that includes a common geography, history, diverse human ties, and cooperation in various spheres of the economy, creates natural competitive advantages for each country and for the Commonwealth as a whole in our difficult times. Now Russia is the chairman of the CIS. Our objectives are built with emphasis on promoting cooperation in trade, economic, scientific, technological, and innovation spheres. A course has been taken towards signing a new Free Trade Zone Treaty before the end of this year. We attach special importance to the development of the Union State of Russia and Belarus, as well as the integration centre represented by the Belarus-Kazakhstan-Russia troika, to the full launch of the Customs Union and the formation of a single economic space. These processes, evolving in the framework of the EurAsEC, as well as the parallel work to strengthen the CSTO, will help to strengthen the positions of our countries in both regional and international affairs. In Russian-Ukrainian relations, an important stage has set in, marking the revival of a genuine mutually beneficial strategic partnership based on the historical commonality of our peoples. Political dialogue has intensified, primarily at the highest level. Russian President Medvedev has just visited Ukraine, and a meeting of the Russian-Ukrainian Interstate Commission has taken place, both events vividly demonstrating the exceptional opportunities to improve the whole range of Russian-Ukrainian relations. Now a few words about the situation in Kyrgyzstan; the situation there remains difficult. Russia actively promotes the stabilization of the situation, its return to the legal field, and provides humanitarian aid to the population of the country. We devote particular attention to the safety and protection of property and other rights and interests of Russian citizens and compatriots. A few days ago President Medvedev appointed V. B. Rushailo as his special representative for the development of relations with Kyrgyzstan. Another thrust area for efforts in the context of the regionalization processes in world politics is to deepen our strategic partnership with the European Union. In November last year in Stockholm, Russia and the EU agreed to start the process of a partnership for modernization. We hope that the summit in Rostov-on-Don, which will be held on May 31-June 1, will adopt a joint position paper on this topic. In addition, in Rostov-on-Don, we would also like to seriously move forward on the abolition of visas. We are going to make it one of the key themes of the summit. For its part, as we have repeatedly emphasized, Russia is ready, even tomorrow, to shift to a visa-free regime, given that the technical consultations of experts on specific aspects of the regime are practically completed. In Brussels, the preparation is continuing of a new framework agreement between Russia and the EU, with the 9th round of negotiations already in progress. Over the past year we have significantly advanced in this work, some articles of the future treaty are agreed in full. Positive dynamics also continue in our bilateral relations with leading European countries, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, as well as a number of other countries. We note the encouraging trends in the development of interaction with the countries in relations with which there were some problems, I mean, first of all, Poland. Against the background of the reaction of the Russian leadership, our entire society to the tragedy near Smolensk, an emotional breakthrough has occurred in the Russian-Polish relationship that creates a unique opportunity to establish relations of genuine good-neighbourliness. Moreover, it is crucial not only for overcoming the common tragic past, but also for the creation of a genuine greater Europe, which is inconceivable without a normal, human dimension of relations between nations and peoples, not clouded by ideological constructs and short-term political interests. The anniversary of Victory and the reminder of the catastrophe of the Second World War and its lessons have greatly contributed to understanding by Europeans the need to build a common house. There have appeared unprecedented opportunities to move forward in the realization of the unity of the entire Euro-Atlantic region. This is the exact meaning of President Medvedev's initiative for a European Security Treaty. On security issues it is impossible to stand still. Inaction or opposition on the establishment of an open region-wide security system will be returning European politics to the past. The Draft European Security Treaty, which we distributed in December last year, is devoted to only one, but fundamental system-forming theme the principle of indivisibility of security. This draft has already caused an interested reaction. We have received about 20 reply messages from Heads of State and Government. It is important that there is the disposition to expand the discussion, reflecting the growing awareness of the unhealthy nature of the situation in this sphere and in European affairs in general. Many people are, at last, beginning to recognize that the end of the Cold War was a consequence of the complex, compromise settlement of relations with Russia. Attempts by some of our partners to act contrary to the then reached understandings, not all of which were put down on paper, were the exact reason for a conflict of expectations that has become characteristic of the state of our relations with the West and which we have only recently begun to overcome. Our initiatives on European security have helped revitalize the OSCE, in whose framework the Corfu Process was launched. There is a rethinking of the role of the OSCE and its institutions. We do not intend to be satisfied with what we have. With the OSCE in its present loose state we will consistently promote the reform of the European organization, which should be strong, effective and actually bolster security and cooperation on the continent in all dimensions, while relying on genuine equality and other principles of international law. We are ready to develop a constructive partnership with NATO in areas where we have common interests and objectives in the field of security. An important indicator of the relevant prospects will be the content of NATO's new strategic concept. The fundamental point is that this document, in our view, should not contain ambiguities regarding the alliance's compliance with the norms of international law, primarily the UN Charter especially in regard to the criteria for the use of force in international relations. Russia has been consistently increasing its cooperation with partners in other regions, contributing to the consolidation of a multipolar world. We are certain that the greater the number of centres of economic growth, financial clout and the consequent political influence, the more stable will be the world arrangement. We are developing the whole complex of relations with the states of Latin America and the Caribbean and with the most dynamic nations in the Asia-Pacific region. We favour the creation in the AP region of a transparent and equitable security architecture, collectively, on the norms and principles of international law, taking into account the legitimate interests of all states and regions. We hold that the creation proposed by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization at a point in the past, of a partnership network of Asian-Pacific regional associations would contribute to strengthening mutual trust and developing fruitful cooperation. We attach utmost importance to the strengthening of the SCO. It is already confidently establishing itself as an important element of the multipolar world order. We are actively preparing for Russia's presidency of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in 2012, and for an APEC summit in Vladivostok. And in the autumn of this year the second Russia ASEAN summit will take place in Hanoi. An important element of Russia's policy not only in the AP region but also globally is the strengthening of strategic cooperation with China. Cooperation between Russia and India is being augmented in all areas. China and India along with Brazil are also our partners in the BRIC, which is a very promising form of interaction between leading states. Our relations are based on common long-term, strategic interests and are characterized by a high level of mutual understanding and mutual trust. One important condition for enhancing global security and stability is to advance the settlement of regional conflicts and crises. Russia participates vigorously and proactively in relevant efforts. It concerns Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria, the Middle East peace process, the situation around Afghanistan, Iran's nuclear programme, as well as the Korean peninsula nuclear issue. The Foreign Ministry intends to continue to build its work on the basis of the need to improve its efficiency and the focus on achieving concrete results in the expansion of cooperation with our partners and with all who are so ready on a mutually advantageous basis. Developed on the President's instruction, the criteria for assessing the results of our foreign policy for accomplishing the tasks of modernization of the Russian economy and its technological breakthrough are oriented towards this end. Work is also nearing completion in an interagency format on a programme for the effective and systemic use of external factors for the long-term development of the country.

Welcome, Dr Waznah. The US occupation forces have started to withdraw their combat troops from Iraq. How is this step viewed within the US Administration? [Waznah] There is certainly a large disappointment within the US Administration as a result of the failure of the Greater Middle East project. Today, the Iraqi people triumphed and the US occupation armies, from which the Iraqi people have long suffered, have started to pull out of Iraq. The first phase of withdrawal is expected to end by the end of this month. This will be followed by the second phase at the end of 2011. The Obama administration is, of course, in the stage of midterm elections for the Senate and House of Representatives and the Democratic Party is waging an electoral campaign at a time when Obama's popularity has largely declined. Therefore, Obama needs to make some accomplishments. The Iraqi people, government, and resistance have today scored a victory marking the beginning of the end of US occupation of Iraq. [Diyab] But the occupation forces are keeping more than 56,000 soldiers in Iraq. How do you view the stay of this large number although the withdrawal of combat troops has been announced? [Waznah] Well, based on the security agreement the Iraqi Government signed with the US Administration, all US troops must leave Iraq by the end of next year. The US Administration has kept in Iraq some security services that are known for their crimes against the Iraqi people. The US forces must abide by the security agreement and refrain from carrying out any operations without the advance approval of the Iraqi Government, but one would not much trust the US Army or its credibility. The 50,000 or 56,000 troops remaining in Iraq are considered a large number of the occupation forces that have killed about a million Iraqis. [Diyab] The US Administration spoke about a different US role and a long-term commitment in Iraq. Does this mean Iraq will remain under US influence for a long time? [Waznah] The structure of the US Embassy in Iraq certainly denotes a long stage of occupation. The largest US embassy in the world is present in Iraq now and it has consulates affiliated with it. There are about 10,000 employees at this embassy and most of them are security and military employees. We, of course, know what these security bodies do. Therefore, what is required from the Iraqi people and resistance is continuing to employ pressure until the Americans are forced to get out of the entire country. There was talk about a possible redeployment of these forces by concentrating them, according to US sources, on the border with Iran and Syria. The US Air Force continues to control Iraqi airspace and military bases continue to be deployed around Iraq. [Diyab] Will the withdrawal of the US combat troops from Iraq benefit another fighting axis? [Waznah] The Americans are living in a dilemma in Afghanistan today. Therefore, there is retreat and a failing strategy as admitted by Petraeus when he was in charge of the Central Command. He is now the US military commander in Afghanistan. Therefore, there are attempts to make greater efforts in Afghanistan. The axis of Afghanistan is still catastrophic for the US Administration. Some voted for Obama in the hope of ending the militarization of US policy in the region. Therefore, Obama needs to respond to those who voted for him among the Democrats, who say they brought him to power in order to withdraw the US troops. He, however, is in his weakest position during this electoral battle. Therefore, there are fears about the issue of Iran and the region. There are fears that Obama's weakness might negatively reflect on regional security. [Diyab] Is there a link between the US combat troops' withdrawal from Iraq and talk about a possible Israeli-US strike to the Iranian nuclear reactor? [Waznah] A clear report was issued by Dennis Ross's team when he was working with a US State Department team although he was outside the US Administration. The report spoke about sanctions on Iran and said these should have a deadline after which there would be a military strike. The United States knows that Iran is not a state but ummah [the community of Muslims worldwide]. If the United States attacks Iran, it will find itself fighting the ummah, and the cost of this battle will be huge. As Imam Khamene'i announced yesterday, the battle will not be with Iran but with a big ummah. I think the Americans understand the meaning of this. Such a battle will be very costly. I think that the Americans tried to avoid a strike in spite of the large Israeli pressure to involve them in a battle that continues to be rejected by the US military. [Diyab] Do you think that US military and technological superiority will be decisive in such a war? [Waznah] When there is a battle on the level of the ummah, the United States may succeed only in directing a limited strike, but the repercussions of the battle will be catastrophic for the United States and its influence worldwide. Therefore, the United States needs to be careful before waging a battle against the ummah, rather than Iran, because Iran is not alone and will not be allowed to be singled out. This will be a war on Muslims in all countries. Muslims are large in number and they have engaged only in self-defence actions thus far. The Imam spoke about a new stage and the issue of defence may develop into a larger and broader stage. This will not be in the interest of the Americans in the long run. [Diyab] Dr Kamil Waznah, an expert in foreign policy affairs, thank you very much. Source: Al-Manar Television, Beirut, in Arabic 1944 gmt 19 Aug 10"
251,The International Herald Tribune,2010-02-17,"On Iran, U.S. finding limits of engagement; Administration affirms policy but is faced with a Tehran that isn't budging",,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,NEWS; Pg. 4,"February 16, 2010",910 words,"White House officials say they have not abandoned President Barack Obama's pledge of engagement, but they are beginning to acknowledge some of the policy's limits. For two days this month, Gen. James L. Jones, President Barack Obama's national security adviser, and Manouchehr Mottaki, the Iranian foreign minister, were in the same place at the same time, attending a high-level security conference in Munich with a number of high-ranking officials from around the world. And yet the two made no plans to meet with each other. Whatever happened to engagement? As a presidential candidate, Mr. Obama declared himself open to dialogue even with intransigent states like Iran. But there is little diplomatic nicety to be seen these days, as the administration presses tough new sanctions aimed at the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in Iran, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton warned Monday of a drift toward a military dictatorship. U.S. officials maintain that they have not abandoned Mr. Obama's pledge of engagement and point to the numerous times in the past year that he reached out to Iran, including a YouTube video to the Iranian people; a letter to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; and even an offer to help Iran buy isotopes for a medical research reactor. But the nonencounter in Munich between General Jones and Mr. Mottaki, like the full-court press on Iran by Mrs. Clinton and other envoys to the region this week, shows that the administration is coming to terms with the limits of its engagement policy, many foreign policy experts say. Ray Takeyh, a former Iran adviser to the administration, said administration officials were learning from experience. ''There was a thesis a year ago that the differences between the United States and Iran was subject to diplomatic mediation, that they could find areas of common experience, that we were ready to have a dialogue with each other,'' Mr. Takeyh said, but ''those anticipations discounted the extent how the Iranian theocracy views engagement with the United States as a threat to its ideological identity.'' And if Mrs. Clinton is correct that the Revolutionary Guards, not the politicians or the clerics, are becoming the central power in Iran, the prospects for rapprochement can only look worse. Not that Iran's political and religious leaders, so far, have demonstrated much interest in Mr. Obama's outreach. Instead, administration officials say, the biggest benefit of Mr. Obama's engagement policy now is not dialogue or understanding with adversaries, but simply a defusing of a worldwide view that the United States is part of the problem, a demonstration that the problem is Tehran's intransigence. ''What the president has achieved is that he has outed Iran,'' a senior administration official said Friday. He said Iran, by refusing to respond positively, had exposed itself as uninterested in a better relationship with the United States. That is now the central point of the new White House outlook on engagement, and it extends, U.S. officials say, to Cuba, North Korea and Venezuela. Mr. Obama, for instance, was criticized for shaking hands with Venezuela's president, Hugo Chávez, at a summit meeting in Trinidad and Tobago last year, but White House officials say that gesture has helped with Latin American views of Mr. Chávez's anti-American rhetoric. In the months ahead, administration officials hope they will benefit from a global perception that Mr. Obama has reached out to Cuba, North Korea and even Syria. At a news briefing on Thursday, the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, presented this latest metamorphosis of the administration's thinking on Iran: that engagement is not necessarily about the two adversaries, but rather, about the worldview on America. The White House, he said, is trying to get Russia and China to join Britain, France, Germany and the United States - a group referred to in diplomatic circles as the P5+1, for the permanent five members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany - in imposing harsher sanctions against Iran for its pursuit of a nuclear program. While it remains unclear whether the effort will succeed, Mr. Gibbs said Mr. Obama's outreach to Iran had paved the way for a united Security Council resolution. ''We would not be here unified in the P5+1 were it not for engagement,'' he said. ''Because we engaged, it demonstrated to the world that the choices that Iran made were choices that it alone had to vouch for.'' That is a far cry from Mr. Obama's past argument about why U.S. and Iranian leaders needed to talk. In his speech to the Muslim world in Cairo in June, he spoke of the need for both nations to overcome decades of mistrust. ''There will be many issues to discuss between our two countries, and we are willing to move forward without preconditions on the basis of mutual respect,'' he said. But that was before the Iranian government's crackdown on protesters disputing the presidential election in June, and before Iran refused to fully sign on to an agreement to ship the country's low-enriched uranium to a third country for further processing. After those events, Mr. Obama has sounded increasingly clear about the limits of engagement. Last Tuesday, he said he had ''bent over backwards to say to the Islamic Republic of Iran that we are willing to have a constructive conversation'' about issues between the two countries. ''They have made their choice so far,'' he added."

Mike Michaud and Chellie Pingree Vote 1: Repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell: The House has agreed to the Senate amendment to the Small Business Act (HR 2965). The amendment, which essentially renames the legislation to the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, would repeal the military's don't ask, don't tell policy for dismissing homosexual soldiers. A proponent, Rep. Susan Davis, D-Calif., said the repeal was supported by military personnel as well as top military officials, and that it would treat gay and lesbian soldiers with fairness. An opponent, Rep. Buck McKeon, R-Calif., said the bill was being brought to a vote ""in complete disregard for the testimony of three of the four service chiefs and their warning that implementing repeal now will have a negative impact on combat readiness."" The vote, on Dec. 15, was 250 yeas to 175 nays. Vote 2: Preventing child marriage: The House has rejected the International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act (S 987), sponsored by Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill. The bill would have directed the president to pursue the foreign policy goal of developing a multiyear strategy for preventing child marriage in developing countries. A proponent, Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., said premature marriage endangered the health of girls under 18 and said: ""We need to invest in these young girls and provide safe spaces where they can evolve socially and become self-sufficient."" Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., cited his concern over a Congressional Budget Office estimate that the bill would cost $67 million and said an alternative program advanced by Republicans would cost under $1 million while achieving the same goals. The vote, on Dec. 16, was 241 yeas to 166 nays, with a two-thirds majority required for approval. Vote 3: Estate Tax Rates: The House has rejected an amendment sponsored by Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., to the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act (HR 4853). The amendment would have set a 45 percent maximum rate for the estate tax in 2011 and 2012 and would have provided a $3.5 million exemption from the tax for single taxpayers and a $7 million exemption for married couples. Levin said the amendment would save $23 billion by setting the estate tax at 2009 levels rather than at the 35 percent maximum rate proposed by the bill. The vote, on Dec. 16, was 194 yeas to 233 nays. Vote 4: Extending Tax Cuts: The House has agreed to the Senate amendment to the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act (HR 4853), sponsored by Rep. James L. Oberstar, D-Minn. The amendment would extend expiring income tax cuts for two years and extend unemployment benefits for 13 months, as well as cut payroll taxes for one year, set new rates for estate taxes and extend tax incentives for such industries as renewable power and ethanol and biodiesel production. A proponent, Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., said the bill was needed to ensure the extension of unemployment benefits and tax cuts for the middle class. An opponent, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., criticized the bill's emphasis on extending tax benefits for the wealthy at a time of increasing poverty. The vote, on Dec. 16, was 277 yeas to 148 nays. Senate votes Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe Vote 1: Offsetting Cost of Tax Cuts: The Senate has rejected a motion by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., to consider an amendment to the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act (HR 4853). The amendment would have cut $150 billion of government spending to offset added government expenses from tax cuts extended in the bill. Coburn said the amendment would prevent further increases in the deficit and show other countries that the U.S. was serious about addressing its debt problems. The vote, on Dec. 15, was 47 yeas to 52 nays. Vote 2: Amendment To Tax Cuts Bill: The Senate has rejected a motion by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to consider an amendment to the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act (HR 4853). The amendment would have replaced cuts in the payroll tax with a one-year extension of the Making Work Pay tax credit, canceled the extension of tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers and used the resulting proceeds to cut the deficit and invest in infrastructure projects. Sanders said his amendment ""creates jobs, cuts the deficit, and it is much fairer than the underlying bill"" it would have amended. The vote, on Dec. 15, was 43 yeas to 57 nays. Vote 3: Extending Tax Cuts: The Senate has approved an amendment sponsored by Sens. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act (HR 4853). The amendment would extend expiring income tax cuts for two years and extend unemployment benefits for 13 months, as well as cut payroll taxes for one year, set new rates for estate taxes and extend tax incentives for such industries as renewable power and ethanol and biodiesel production. Reid said the amendment would improve economic security for middle-class families and ""ensure that Americans who are still looking for work will continue to have the safety net they rely on to make ends meet."" An opponent, Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., criticized the amendment for failing to repeal the estate tax and extending tax provisions only temporarily, and therefore failing to end uncertainty about taxes ""that makes it very difficult for businesses to plan."" The vote, on Dec. 15, was 81 yeas to 19 nays. Vote 4: Nuclear Weapons Treaty With Russia: The Senate has agreed to a motion to proceed to executive session for consideration of a treaty with Russia to reduce the number of strategic nuclear weapons held by Russia and the U.S. A proponent of the treaty, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said the treaty would reduce the threat posed by Russia's nuclear weapons, promote nuclear nonproliferation efforts against Iran, North Korea, Syria and Burma, and ""avoid the added burden and uncertainties of an intensified arms competition with Russia."" The vote, on Dec. 15, was 66 yeas to 32 nays. Compiled by Targeted News Service for the Bangor Daily News."

""Slavery is a crushing mark on America's soul, yet today half of all black children are aborted. Far more black children, far more of the African American community is being devastated by the policies of today than were being devastated by the policies of slavery,"" Franks told video blogger Mike Stark of StarkReports.com. The Silent Palestinian Refugee Crisis In the perpetual Middle Eastern conflict, everyone gets a bit of the limelight-the Hamas rockets, the Israeli air strikes and more recently, illegal Jewish settlements and an inhuman blockade. Except the nearly 3,00,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, who have been denied the basic rights afforded to their compatriots in Syria and Jordan, write Taylor Long and Alistair Harris. ""Palestinians refugees suffer from their involvement in Lebanon's 15-year civil war. Since the war's end, the Lebanese government has stripped Palestinians of rights they once enjoyed."" But now, a proposed legislation in the Lebanese Parliament could change that. ""The proposed law would provide (the Palestinians) with an increased measure of basic rights, expand their employment opportunities and give them the right to prosecute violations of their employment rights, to own property, and to collect social security,"" write Long and Harris. 254 of 266 DOCUMENTS Weekend Australian March 27, 2010 Saturday 1 - All-round Country Edition Australia should not follow the US President's lead BARACK Obama's anti-Israel jihad is one of the most irresponsible policy lurches by any modern American president. It rightly earns Obama the epithet of the US president least sympathetic to Israel in Israel's history. Jimmy Carter became a great hater of Israel, but only after he left office. Obama's dangerous new lurch into anti-Israel populism changes global politics in extremely dangerous ways, and poses a challenge for Kevin Rudd. Perhaps Obama's most distinctive contribution to the foreign policy debate in the lead-up to the US presidential election was his avowed determination to talk to and engage the US's enemies if he became president. He was happy in principle to talk to Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but did not know for sure that the Iranian president wielded real power. But he sent all manner of felicitations and greetings to Iran and its government. When that government stole an election on Ahmadinejad's behalf and viciously brutalised its citizens, Obama refrained from speaking too much or too forcefully, as, he said, he didn't want to be seen to be interfering in Iranian internal affairs. When Obama met the king of Saudi Arabia, a nation in which no one votes, women are subject to severe and demeaning restrictions and it is against the law to have a Christian church, Obama bowed in deep respect. When Obama ran into Venezuela's murderous despot, Hugo Chavez, at a summit, there was a friendly greeting observed by all. But there is one leader whom Obama draws the line at. He will not be seen in public with Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Astonishingly, when Netanyahu saw Obama at the White House this week, all photographers and all TV cameras were banned, a level of humiliation almost completely unique in modern White House practice. You might even conclude that Obama is trying to interfere in internal Israeli politics and bring down a government. This is something post-colonial, post-multicultural Obama would never do with Iran, but with Israel, the US's longstanding ally, it's fine. And what was Netanyahu's crime, this act of infamy that Obama's senior staff described as an ``affront'' to America? It was that the relevant housing authority passed another stage of approval for 1600 Israeli housing units to be built in East Jerusalem in about three years' time. It was very foolish that the Israelis allowed this announcement to take place while US Vice-President Joe Biden was in Israel. But they apologised to Biden at the time, Biden kissed and made up with the Israelis and was back to delivering fulsome pro-Israel speeches before he left. After that point, though, the US reaction went into overdrive. Impeccable American sources tell me this reaction was driven by Obama, and to a lesser extent the Chicago mafia around him. We must ask why this is so, but first let's get Netanyahu's infamous crime into perspective. Last November Netanyahu announced a 10-month moratorium on all building activity in Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Israel has already promised not to take any more land for settlements but there is the question of renovating existing buildings and constructing new ones in existing settlements. As Hillary Clinton acknowledged in her speech this week to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, East Jerusalem was never part of this agreement. The two main peace offers Israel has made to the Palestinians in recent years were the Camp David/Taba proposals and the accompanying Clinton parameters in 2000, and Ehud Olmert's offer to Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas in 2008. Both plans offered essentially the same formula. The Palestinians get all of the Gaza Strip, about 95 per cent of the West Bank and a compensating parcel of territory from Israel proper to make up for the small amount of territory in the West Bank that Israel would keep which houses the main Jewish population blocks. The Palestinians also get some parts of East Jerusalem as their capital. This principle of territorial swaps was accepted by Yasser Arafat and Abbas. East Jerusalem has always had a different status from the West Bank and some Israelis certainly don't want to give any of it to a new Palestinian state. But everyone accepts that some Jewish neighbourhoods would remain part of Israel. These are mostly neighbourhoods, as Netanyahu pointed out this week, which are five minutes from the Knesset and a couple of blocks beyond the 1949 armistice line. The administration of George W. Bush had formally agreed with the Israelis that these areas would be permanently part of Israel. Bill Clinton had negotiated an offer to the Palestinians in 2000 which accepted this. It would be a radical change of policy for an Israeli government to decree that no building would ever take place in Jewish areas of Jerusalem. It would also be a change of American policy. Moreover, no serious analyst could believe that such building is a roadblock to peace. Peace negotiations have gone on with such building taking place in the past. And all the things that truly make peace impossible -- Arab and Palestinian refusal to accept the legitimacy of any Jewish state, Palestinian insistence on certain deal breakers such as the right of return of all Palestinian refugees and their descendants to Israel proper, the insistent and violent anti-Semitism of Palestinian and Arab propaganda and the regional ambitions of players such as Iran and Syria -- will be completely unaffected by any decision to build apartments in a Jewish neighbourhood in East Jerusalem in three years time. So why has Obama gone into full jihad mode against Israel? Three explanations suggest themselves. Obama has had a terrible year in foreign policy. He has achieved nothing on Iran or China or anything else of consequence. He is too smart to believe this intimidation of Israel will advance peace, but it might get peace talks going again. The Palestinians only made settlements a roadblock after Obama did. They are refusing to join Israel in peace talks, which Netanyahu would be happy to participate in. They have said they might engage in proximity talks -- which means not talking to the Israelis directly but to mediators who will shuttle back and forth carrying messages between them and the Israelis. This is primitive and ridiculous stuff, but if such talks get going Obama could claim some kind of victory, or at least progress. And Obama is showing that his personal popularity, not America's standing, still less matters of substance such as Iran's nuclear program, is what motivates him. This leads to the second explanation of his behaviour, and that is to make himself personally popular in the Muslim world. Beating up on Israel is the cheapest trick in the book on that score and it can earn him easy, worthless and no doubt temporary plaudits in some parts of the Muslim world. And thirdly, Obama is the first post-multicultural president of America. In his autobiography he talks of seeking out the most radical political theorists he could at university. For these people Israel is an exercise in Western neo-imperialism. Obama makes their hearts sing with this anti-Israel jihad. Accompanying Obama's own actions has been some of the most dangerous rhetoric ever to come out of a US administration, to the effect that Israeli intransigence endangers US troops by inflaming extremists in the Islamic world. No serious analyst anywhere believes that Israel is an important source of the conflicts in Afghanistan or Iraq. Using this type of argument comes dangerously close to the administration licensing a mutant strain of anti-Semitism -- it's all the Jews' fault. Why is all this a challenge for Rudd? The anti-Israel hysteria is totally disproportionate and wildly over the top. The British decision to expel an Israeli diplomat because Israel is alleged to have used forged British passports in a Mossad operation is a case in point. The British precedent pressures Rudd to do the same. Rudd should resist this pressure, as Opposition leader Tony Abbott has urged him to. 2010 is a critical year for the Middle East. Israel's friends now should rally round it, or the spectre of wild and hysterical anti-Israel sentiment will be unleashed with all manner of destructive consequences. Now is the time for anyone who cares about Middle East peace, or who claims as Rudd does to care about Israel, to stick close to Jerusalem. The Australian Federal Police inquiry will not be conclusive about whether Israel used Australian passports or not. Obama wants to be popular. Gordon Brown wants Muslim votes and to distract attention from the latest scandals of his government. Rudd could be tempted to bash Israel as a way of courting Arab League votes at the UN. But the path of statesmanship here does not lie in apeing these foolish American and British moves. There would also be a gruesome comparison in the way Australia responds to big as to small nations. China imprisons one of our citizens, denies consular access to most of the trial and treats Canberra with contempt. In return Rudd changes policy and declines to see the Dalai Lama and similarly declines to send an Australian minister to Taiwan in the entire course of the government's parliamentary term. Yet Israel, our close friend, is alleged to misuse a passport and then gets the very big diplomatic penalty of having a diplomat expelled. It would be disproportionate and foolish and cowardly. The Americans and Brits don't always get things right. There are times when Canberra should definitely not follow their lead."
255,The Philadelphia Daily News,2010-11-17,"Torsella nominated for U.N. post, but could face Sestak-like blowback",FINAL Edition,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,LOCAL; P-com Biggie News Update; Pg. 07,"November 17, 2010",619 words,"President Obama on Monday named Joe Torsella to a top post at the United Nations in a move that could raise questions among Republicans who take control of the U.S. House in January. Torsella, 47, chairman of the Pennsylvania Board of Education since 2008, was nominated to be the U.S. representative for U.N. Management and Reform. He served twice as president of the National Constitution Center and was deputy mayor for policy and planning when Gov. Rendell was mayor of Philadelphia. Torsella's nomination is likely to spark comparisons to the controversy about a post that the White House offered earlier this year to U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak. Sestak said that he had been offered a job in exchange for dropping out of the Democratic primary race against U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter. Torsella had previously announced a run for the Democratic nomination but dropped out after Specter left the GOP. Torsella and the U.S. mission to the U.N. declined to comment yesterday on his nomination. Torsella's appointment must be confirmed, first in a hearing of the U.S. Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, then by the full Senate. He will see a familiar face during his confirmation hearing: Sen. Bob Casey Jr., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. Casey yesterday praised Torsella's work for the city and state, and predicted ""a swift Senate confirmation."" Specter said yesterday that Torsella's ""academic qualifications and professional credentials make him an excellent addition to this administration."" Specter vowed to help Torsella reach confirmation. Torsella, who lives in Flourtown, spent three months last year in the race for Specter's Senate seat. He dropped out when Specter, at the urging of Rendell and Obama, joined the Democratic Party. Sestak entered the race against Specter two weeks after Torsella withdrew in May 2009. Republicans assailed Sestak during the primary and general elections after he said that former President Bill Clinton, acting on behalf of the White House, tried to lure him out of the race against Specter with a job offer. The White House Counsel's Office on May 28 explained that Clinton had offered Sestak an unpaid post on an intelligence advisory board if he would drop his Senate bid and remain in the U.S. House. Specter lost the May 18 Democratic primary to Sestak, who then lost the Nov. 2 general election to Republican former U.S. Rep. Pat Toomey. Gary Tuma, Rendell's spokesman, said in September that the governor had ""recommended Joe to the White House for a number of positions"" after Torsella dropped out of the Senate race. Tuma yesterday said that Rendell had recommended Torsella for the U.N. job. In college Torsella befriended Susan Rice, now the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. They were Rhodes Scholars at Oxford University, in England, in 1986. Rice donated $1,608 to Torsella's Senate campaign, receiving a refund after he dropped out. Republicans, especially U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, of California, may raise questions about Torsella's appointment. Issa, ranking Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, repeatedly questioned whether the Obama administration had broken federal law in the Sestak offer. A spokesman for Issa declined to comment yesterday. Issa has said that he wants to hold more hearings on the actions of the Obama administration when his political party takes control of the House in January. Torsella replaces Ambassador Joseph Melrose Jr., a three-decade veteran of the foreign service, who served as ambassador to Sierra Leone and is now the acting U.S. representative for U.N. Management and Reform. Melrose, who served in Vietnam, Syria, Pakistan, Nigeria and Kenya, is also a professor at Ursinus College, in Collegeville."
256,The Pioneer (India),2010-07-12,Russia refashions its geo-strategy,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"July 11, 2010",,"India, July 12 -- The warming of Washington's relations with Moscow is a crucial factor, writes Nikolai Dimlevich Russia gained enormous foreign-politics experience across the world in the imperial epoch and in the Soviet era. Assessing the Russian-US relations over the past year from the standpoint of this experience, one readily concludes that the highlight for the period of time has been Washington's generous offer to press the reset button. No doubt, there are profound reasons why the US wants its relations with Russia reset. After September 11, 2001 Washington's foreign politics was entirely dominated by the vision of a unipolar world. The US political establishment was convinced that Russia had lost the Cold War but was nevertheless treated gently considering that no effective ruler like Gen D MacArthur was installed to act as its vice-king. The majority of the US politicians including all of Mr George Bush's Administration were under the impression that the Kremlin's reaction to the situation was that of ingratitude and that Russia's political course was both illogical and unacceptable. Like the Roman emperors who could not agree to king of Armenia Mithridates' claiming his own sphere of influence, Washington could not accept the aspirations of the post-Soviet Russia. At that moment, Washington's priority was to demonstrate to both Russia and Serbia that it was the US who had the final say in the Balkan affairs, and eventually not only the Kremlin but also the rest of the world were forced to realise to what extent this was the case. In 2006, Ms Condoleezza Rice bluntly interrupted Russian diplomacy chief Sergei Lavrov at the hearings in the Council on Foreign Relations by saying she had already told him the problems related to the territories west of the Danube were not to be discussed. Why was Washington so outraged by Russia's resolute response to the Georgian aggression against South Ossetia and the killing of Russian peace-keepers? The reason was that for the US Georgia's President Mikheil Saakashvili was the number one partner in the Caucasus, and Moscow's dealing him a blow called into question the widening of the US hegemony. As a result, the situation during the last six months of Mr Bush's presidency resembled that of the second half of 1983 when the South Korean Boeing drama prompted an outpouring of emotions in Moscow and Washington, and the dialogue between the USSR and the US had to be completely suspended. It did not evade watchers that in 2008 the US reaction was in part shaped by the affectivity of Ms Rice who perceived the August developments in the Caucasus as her personal diplomatic defeat. From a broader perspective, the US's ""righteous indignation"" was due to the fact that, leveling as much criticism at Russia as it wished to, it clearly lacked the potential to actually influence Moscow without harming Washington's own interests. Quite a few forces in today's world would be happy to see the US and Russia clash, and in the light of the fact the new US Administration's pledge to reset the relations with Moscow gives a cause for cautious optimism. At the same time, one should keep in mind that the US founding fathers with all their internal disagreements invariably shared the view that they had invented a superior form of statehood and that it was their mission to spread it across the world, converting peoples to their political faith or - if necessary - helping peoples displace their rulers if they stood in the way. Even nowadays, the essentially messianic notion, which is clearly rooted in Protestantism, remains the underlying philosophy of the US international politics. Unlike philosophy, the political tactic has to be based on compromises, and the Kremlin is ready to embrace those in various spheres. Strictly speaking, Russia's presidents were markedly open to compromise throughout the post-Soviet epoch, while the US position used to be asymmetric. The advent of the new US Administration revived hopes that serious compromises can be reached, but the first and extremely important step must be to set fair and transparent rules of the game. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is calling for a new European Security Pact as the mechanisms built in the framework of the once useful Helsinki Accords no longer guarantee the same level of security to all European countries. Recently, Russia and the US penned the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. In the context, though Moscow had to state unilaterally that this treaty is contingent upon the US's not building up its missile defence to the level at which Russia's nuclear deterrent might be eroded. Russia is offered to join the US-led collective missile defence system, but at the moment the plan appears to be an equation with many unknowns. While the benefits of joining in are obvious, Moscow should make sure that Russia's own defence research will not be constrained under the arrangement. Another dimension of the problem is that Russia - in the case of its integration into the European missile defense initiative - has to avoid being dragged into the ongoing conflict between the US and the countries Washington regards as sources of threat to the US and its allies. In other words, Russia can cooperate with Nato, but not at the cost of alienating Iran, Syria, or North Korea. -To be continued Published by HT Syndication with permission from Pioneer.

257,The Straits Times (Singapore),2010-06-11,"Turkey: Once US ally, now challenger; It has created third camp: Not anti-US but still directly challenging US influence",,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,,"June 10, 2010",888 words,"On Wednesday, Mr Obama hosted Mr Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, to discussions aimed at restarting the long-suspended peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians. The White House also announced a new US $400 million (S $565 million) aid package for the reconstruction of Gaza, a gesture designed to indicate it no longer supports Israel's strategy of starving that territory into submission. However, although few US officials cared to admit it publicly, one of their main objectives this week was to tackle Turkey, a country which has voted against new sanctions on Iran, and increasingly challenges American influence in the Arab world. The transformation of Turkey from an ally of both the US and Israel into one of America's top regional competitors represents one of the most significant developments in the Middle East. For it has the potential to redraw the map of the entire region, largely at the expense of American strategic interests. Officially, the shift in Turkey's diplomacy comes in response to recent Israeli actions, such as the destruction inflicted on Palestinians, or the killing last week of nine Turkish citizens during the Israeli seizure of an aid ship which attempted to break the blockade on Gaza. The Turks castigate the Americans for shielding the Jewish state from international justice. But the reality is that the dispute with Israel is just a symptom of a more profound change in Turkey's policies. For almost a century, Turkey regarded itself as a secular European state, rather than a Middle Eastern nation. It was the first Muslim state to establish diplomatic relations with Israel. It remained a staunch member of the US-led Nato alliance. And it repeatedly applied for European Union membership. Turkey's political elite looked down on Arab nations and the Arabs dismissed the Turks as just a decrepit former colonial power. Over the last two decades, however, matters have shifted. Turks are now more pious, and a mildly Islamic party has ruled the country since 2002. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan denies accusations that he intends to elevate religion to state ideology. But, plainly, his country now sees itself as part of a wider Islamic family. The Americans, who watch these developments with anxiety, tend to blame Europe for Turkey's current pro-Islamic tilt. During a trip to Britain this week, US Defence Secretary Robert Gates alleged that Turkey may have been 'pushed by some in Europe' away from the EU and into closer partnerships with states like Iran. This interpretation is almost certainly wrong. Europe's inability to consider Turkey as an equal partner is clearly counter-productive. Still, Europe was responsible for promoting the reforms which made Turkey the world's 16th biggest economic power, and for consolidating Turkey's political institutions. Turkey turned more Islamic because its old political elite failed to offer an alternative vision; outsiders could never influence this process. Much of Turkey's current policies remain contradictory. Prime Minister Erdogan asks the world to treat his own Kurdish separatists as terrorists, but regards Hamas, a Palestinian organisation on the global terrorist list, as a 'liberation movement'. Mr Erdogan also claims to support the territorial integrity of states, but has castigated China for perpetrating 'genocide' in Xinjiang. And, while he regards Israel's nuclear weapons as a 'major threat to international stability', Mr Erdogan believes that Iran's nuclear quest is only 'peaceful'. But none of this has prevented Turkey's popularity from soaring in the Arab world. Its example as a nation which combines modernity with economic development and religious pride is irresistible. A recent opinion poll conducted by the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation indicates that 75 per cent of Middle Easterners look up to Turkey. For the US, the rise of the new Turkey presents a major challenge. Until recently, the Middle East was divided into two camps: countries which support the US-led status quo, and nations such as Iran or Syria who are America's sworn enemies. Now, Turkey has created a third camp, composed of nations which are not necessarily anti-American, but which are still directly challenging US strategic objectives. The Turkish example - of actively working to limit US influence, while retaining normal relations with Washington - could well be copied by other Islamic nations such as Malaysia and Indonesia. And it has already marginalised countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which are now seen as American stooges. For the moment, Washington is ignoring Turkey's initiatives, without picking a fight. But few US officials believe that this is a viable, long-term strategy. One way or another, as Mr Josef Joffe, the editor of one of Germany's top newspapers, gloomily notes, 'next to Iran, Turkey is now the biggest headache for the West'. jonathan.eyal@gmail.com The transformation of Turkey from an ally of both the US and Israel into one of America's top regional competitors represents one of the most significant developments in the Middle East."
258,The Daily Star (Lebanon),2010-12-09,Barack Obama has fallen short in stymieing America's decline,,20,Newspaper,,Randa Takieddine,ENGLISH,,"June 2, 2010",749 words,"Humbled by the Republicans' landslide mid-term election victory, US President Barack Obama will now need to negotiate every minor detail of his domestic agenda with a confrontational Congress - at least until the next elections in 2012. Congress can obstruct Obama's foreign policy as well, but this remains a domain where any US president ""enjoys almost royal prerogatives Humbled by the Republicans' landslide mid-term election victory, US President Barack Obama will now need to negotiate every minor detail of his domestic agenda with a confrontational Congress - at least until the next elections in 2012. Congress can obstruct Obama's foreign policy as well, but this remains a domain where any US president ""enjoys almost royal prerogatives,"" to use Alexis de Tocqueville's somewhat inflated description. These prerogatives, however, have so far allowed Obama only to describe the world that he wants, not to bring it about. George W. Bush committed the cardinal sin of all fallen empires - that of overreach. The Obama alternative was supposed to be collective global security sustained by multilateral structures. Rather than containing rising powers such as China and India, they would be drawn into a civilized world order, one based on global governance and ""smart diplomacy."" Yet, instead of building such an order, Obama's presidency has so far been a mighty struggle to stem the decline in American power. He has fallen desperately short in making real progress toward the Promised Land, in which America lives in peace with the Muslim world, thanks to an Israeli-Palestinian settlement; brings about a nuclear-free planet (a noble, yet entirely delusional pledge); gets Russia's support in addressing other global problems; contains China's quest to translate its growing economic power into major strategic gains; ends its two diversionary wars in Muslim countries; and leads a solid international alliance to cut short Iran's nuclear ambitions. Foreign policy has almost invariably been the refuge of US presidents hit by mid-term defeats. But foreign policy cannot be detached from its domestic foundations altogether. Can a president shown to be hesitant in the Middle East and Afghanistan even before his mid-term setback muster the authority needed to advance his global vision after such a domestic debacle? One should hope so, if only because no better alternative to Obama's vision is in view. And now, with a Republican-controlled House of Representatives, Obama might not be able to fulfill major foreign-policy promises, including ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a key item in the president's vision for reinvigorating the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Should Congress not ratify the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia, Obama's most tangible foreign-policy achievement so far, the entire inspection system for nuclear arms might collapse. But, with respect to most other foreign-policy issues, the question is one of presidential leadership. Obama's problem lies not in his vision for America and the world, but in his deficient efforts to move from theory to practice. Nevertheless, despite the new Congress' overwhelmingly pro-Israel cast, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should not assume that the Republicans will stymie Obama if he pushes resolutely for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. After all, it was a Republican who produced the Reagan Plan, calling on Israel to withdraw to the 1967 borders. Thus, however much they despised the former US president, Bill Clinton, the Republicans were prepared to allow him the glory of being a Middle East peacemaker, believing that any agreement reached with the Palestinians at the 2000 Camp David Summit was in America's interest. Obama was recently advised by David Broder, a long-time Washington Post columnist, to launch an attack on Iran. Convinced that history will judge the president by his success in containing the Iranian threat, Broder also assumed that a war with Iran would reignite the American economy. That was a strange idea, given that today's two ongoing wars have only compounded the weaknesses of the US economy. An American war against Iran is plausible only as a response to a blatant and immediate Iranian challenge to vital US interests, such as a major terrorist attack, an invasion of an ally in the Gulf, or disruption of the free flow of Middle East oil to the West. The Iranian regime is far too astute to cross any of these red lines. Iran, like North Korea, will continue to test Obama's capacity to build international alliances aimed at putting pressure on defiant states. Those, like Netanyahu, who stick to the lunacy of a military operation against Iran, will not find a ready ally in Obama. Such an operation would make America appear to be doing Israel's bidding - even George W. Bush refused when former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert asked the US to attack a Syrian nuclear reactor - and destroy Obama's strategy of reconciliation with the Muslim world. Glory in foreign policy is no guarantee of future electoral gains. Conversely, Obama did not lose the mid-term elections because of his foreign policy's inconsistencies. He lost because US unemployment remains near 10 percent, with no prospect of rapid improvement. And only one major foreign-policy test for Obama has clear implications for the US economy and job creation: the need to recalibrate relations with China in a way that restores balance to bilateral trade. At the end of the day, Bill Clinton was right, now, as then: ""It's the economy, stupid."" It certainly wasn't - and isn't - foreign policy, as George H. W. Bush, one of America's most proficient presidents in international affairs - can attest.

THE DAILY STAR publishes this commentary in collaboration with Project Syndicate © (www.project-syndicate.org). 259 of 266 DOCUMENTS Dar Al Hayat (Lebanon) June 2, 2010 Wednesday International Edition Why the Shock at Israeli Piracy? The shock of the world and international media at the act of maritime piracy by Israeli forces against the Turkish vessel Mavi Marmara, which was headed to Gaza with humanitarian supplies, is not justified. The massacre against the Freedom Flotilla, which wanted to break the blockade of Gaza, represents the logic and path of Israel policy for decades, when the world felt shocked but did nothing. Since the crimes of Qana in Lebanon, the Israeli war on Lebanon in 2006, then its war against Gaza in 2008, and the independent or ""unbiased"" reports, such as Goldstone, the western world has not dared to confront Israel with harsh policies and tangible sanctions. Instead, each side has raced to say that it is keen to preserve Israel's security and safety, and it wants to move the peace process forward. However, all of Israel's friends in the west, led by the United States, are avoiding any confrontation with the real status quo, which is that the Israeli government does not want peace and does not want a Palestinian state on its borders. Israel is feeding all of the extremist and terrorist movements in the region, without any oversight or punishment. Why the surprise and shock, then amnesia, and lack of accountability? Instead, we see Israel rewarded, by being accepted into a long-standing organization such as the OECD, and welcomed as an advanced, modern and democratic state. Despite all of the shock and condemnation in media and official circles in the west, the summoning of Israeli ambassadors, and the official statements that disapprove of ""using disproportionate force,"" it has become customary for Israel to continue with its policy, as it leads the Middle East into becoming a source for hard-line and extremist movements. It is clear that since talk began about a peace track and peace negotiations, Israel has been in the rejectionist front; the west has done nothing to pressure it to accept international resolutions, ones that have been approved by all leading western powers, including the US, and Europe, as well as by other influential countries in the world. Who has not implemented the Road Map? Who has rejected a halt to settlements? Who has refused to lift the blockade of the Palestinian people and of Gaza? Where is the punishment for this rejection? There has been nothing, while Arab regimes threatened to go to the Security Council, but... nothing! What else? The current Israeli government, and those before it, did not want peace. The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, is completely aware of this, but continues in his policy of negotiation, to show the world that the problem does not lie with the Palestinians, but rather with Israel. The Jewish state does not want a Palestinian state on its borders. It prefers to see radical Islamists remain, and this was its policy when it began to pressure the Christians of Jerusalem, to displace them, so that the Jewish state remains alone facing extremist Muslim elements. The first one who warned of this was Faisal al-Husseini, the Palestinian leader who visited France a few months before his death, to tell the Bishop of Paris and then-French President Jacques Chirac: do not let the Christians of Jerusalem leave, because Israel is doing everything it can to displace the Christians of Palestine, so that it will be alone in facing extremist Islam, and feed this extremism. This is what happened, and is continuing to happen, because of Israel's acts. The same logic applied when Israel launched its brutal war on Lebanon in 2006, on the pretext that it would get rid of Hizbullah. However, it made the party into a hero for the Arab public. Israel claimed that it wants to negotiate with Syria via Turkey. However, it has done everything it could to work on a deterioration of relations with this Turkish intermediary; the latest act was the piracy and the slaughter of the Mavi Marmara, in international waters. The shock and condemnation of brutal acts and violations of all international laws are of no use, as long as escaping punishment remains the rule, especially with big powers like the US and the European Union, vis-à-vis Israel. The responsibility of Arab regimes is considerable, because they can change the course of events, due to their linkages to the interests of western countries. Arab states can pressure these states, if only Arab states had a unified position on how to confront the policies of the Jewish state, which will continue in this fashion!"

His new book, ''The Religious Test: Why We Must Question the Beliefs of Our Leaders,'' will be published in the fall. A Biography By Thomas L. Jeffers Illustrated. 393 pp. Cambridge University Press. $35 The Contentious Magazine That Transformed the Jewish Left Into the Neoconservative Right By Benjamin Balint 290 pp. PublicAffairs. $26.95 Over the past decade, ''neocon'' has become an all-purpose term of abuse among critics of the right. Yet few of these critics appear to realize that from the beginning there have been two very different branches of neoconservative thinking. The first aimed to bring sober, dispassionate analysis and a skeptical temper to questions of domestic policy; the second specialized in devising cogent, often highly polemical arguments in favor of a militarily aggressive foreign policy. The first exercised its greatest political influence during the 1990s with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's crime-fighting policies and the 1996 Welfare Reform Act. The second peaked in the years immediately after 9/11, when the administration of George W. Bush pursued a doctrine of unilateral pre-emptive war and set out to transform Islamic civilization at gunpoint. When critics denounce neocons, they rarely mean the first branch, which today is largely extinct. Instead, they mean the ideas and outlook associated with the second branch. That ultimately means the ideas and outlook of Norman Podhoretz and Commentary magazine, which he edited from 1960 to 1995. Thomas L. Jeffers's exhaustive but frustratingly uncritical biography, ''Norman Podhoretz,'' is most engaging in its early chapters, telling the story of how this brilliant and ambitious child of Jewish immigrants from Galicia rose from poverty in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn to become first, the star student of the great literary critic Lionel Trilling at Columbia University and then, at the age of 30, the editor of Commentary, the magazine of the American Jewish Committee and one of the two leading journals (along with Partisan Review) of the legendary New York Intellectuals. By the late 1960s, Podhoretz's considerable talents as a writer, critic, editor and high-spirited raconteur had won him a place at the center of the cultural and political action. Commentary published leading lights of the New Left like Paul Goodman, Herbert Marcuse and Norman O. Brown. Podhoretz jousted with Norman Mailer and Allen Ginsberg at parties and in print. He organized soirees for Jackie Kennedy. Jeffers, a professor of literature at Marquette University, skillfully weaves together these and countless other stories of Podhoretz's dramatic ascent to the peak of influence within the liberal intellectual world. But he runs into problems when he tries to explain Podhoretz's march to the right, which began around 1970 and has never ceased. In 1972 Podhoretz broke from the Democratic Party to vote for Nixon. By the end of the decade, he was an enthusiastic supporter of Ronald Reagan. But it wasn't long before he was taking to the pages of The New York Times Magazine to assail Reagan for insufficient toughness in confronting the Soviet Union and defending Israel. By 2002, Podhoretz had moved so far right that he thought George W. Bush's bellicose response to the 9/11 attacks was merely a good start; in addition to attacking all three members of Bush's ''axis of evil'' (Iraq, Iran and North Korea), Podhoretz insisted that the United States needed to prepare for military assaults on Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Libya. Today he believes Sarah Palin would make a perfectly fine president. How could a once thoughtful man spend the past 40 years transforming himself into a commissar? In his 1979 memoir, ''Breaking Ranks,'' Podhoretz himself described his initial lurch to the right as a perfectly sensible reaction to the excesses of the counterculture, the rise of a black power movement tainted by anti-Semitism, the descent of the antiwar movement into nihilistic violence and the Democratic Party's embrace of left-wing isolationism in 1972. Jeffers accepts this account but adds a surprising theological twist, telling us that in February 1970, Podhoretz experienced a mystical vision in the woods of upstate New York that convinced him ''Judaism was true.'' Jeffers has difficulty explaining precisely what this revelation meant, and how it inspired Podhoretz to change his political views, no doubt in part because it had no discernible effect on his observance of Jewish law and rituals. As Podhoretz himself puts it, he felt it unnecessary, both before and after the vision, ''to go to services, eat kosher, all that stuff.'' To grasp the true significance of the vision, the reader must skip ahead about 120 pages in Jeffers's narrative to a 1985 speech in which Podhoretz spoke of his pride at using Commentary to defend ''my own'' -- ''my own country'' and ''my own people.'' In light of these comments, Podhoretz's revelation appears to mark the moment in his life when he began to ''unlearn'' what, he said, he had been educated to believe as a liberal -- namely, ''that it was more honorable and nobler to turn one's back on one's own and fight for others and for other things in which one had no personal stake or interest.'' Beginning with his vision in the woods, Podhoretz would devote his life to standing up for himself as a Jew and as an American against an ever lengthening list of those he deemed to be mortal enemies. The story of American Judaism's growing self-confidence -- its increasing willingness to defend itself as well as its move from the periphery to the center of cultural and political power in the United States -- is the unifying thread of Benjamin Balint's beautifully written and richly researched history of Commentary from its founding in 1945 (15 years before Podhoretz took over), to 2010 (15 years after his retirement). By placing the man and the magazine in this broader context, Balint, a fellow at the Hudson Institute and a former assistant editor at Commentary, manages to strike just the right balance between respectful admiration and critical distance. The result is the best book to date about neoconservatism -- and one offering far greater insight into the mind and career of Norman Podhoretz than Jeffers's obsequious biography. ''Running Commentary'' describes how the vision of the magazine in its early years was shaped by Elliot Cohen, its gifted founding editor. Cohen believed that intellectuals -- writers who were seriously interested in the arts, literature and ideas -- were bound to feel alienated from American life with its middle-class mores and middlebrow taste. That Commentary was a Jewish periodical in a predominately Christian country only intensified the feeling of estrangement. And yet by the time Podhoretz took over in 1960, the alienation had begun to wane, with the magazine tentatively, though still critically, affirming aspects of American life. In his first decade as editor, Podhoretz sharpened its critical edge, increasing its distance from the political mainstream. But by 1970, he had concluded that the criticism had gone too far, and that Commentary should take the lead in defending the United States, Judaism and Israel. Podhoretz wasn't wrong to sense a certain nobility in standing up for ''one's own.'' Yet his self-defense, to the exclusion of other human values, be they moral, literary or intellectual, has come at a cost. Today Commentary regularly publishes essays that sound, in Balint's apt words, ''like speeches intended to buck up the troops or self-congratulatory sermons to the faithful.'' As for Podhoretz himself, he has grown so intolerant of criticism and dissent, so terrified of impending doom at the hands of militant Muslims, and so furious with his fellow Jews that his intemperate rantings are dismissed by all but his neoconservative progeny. The Brownsville wunderkind has ended up an embittered, paranoid crank, standing by and for himself alone."
262,Jerusalem Post,2010-09-06,Turkey-Israel relations: Where do we stand?,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,OPINION; Pg. 14,"February 22, 2011",978 words,"Lately, it seems Turkey is showing a more conciliatory stance vis-^-vis Israel. A senior Turkish official told Yediot Aharonot recently that the two countries must now ""avoid escalation,"" quiet down ""the verbal incitement"" and once the crisis ends the Israeli prime minister would be ""welcome in Ankara."" To salvage the relations Turkey is ""only"" asking Israel ""to issue some sort of an apology and compensate the victims' families."" Actually, the contradictory statements by Turkish leaders, some escalating the situation, others calming tensions, are the result of two conflicting constraints: the attempt by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to use the May 31 flotilla crisis to strengthen the governing Justice and Development (AK) Party before the critical September 12 referendum and the growing pressure by the US to keep Turkey as an important ally. The attempts to mend fences with Israel began at the end of June, when Industry, Trade and Labor Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer secretly met Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu in Brussels, apparently due to pressure from the Obama administration. President Barack Obama reportedly warned Erdogan that actions Turkey has taken in its relations with Israel and its vote against sanctions on Iran ""have caused worry in Congress"" concerning its standing as an ally. He allegedly called on Ankara to cool its rhetoric about the flotilla raid. Also, for the first time in the US-Turkey relationship, the House Foreign Affairs Committee conducted a special hearing on whether Turkey's axis is indeed shifting, and Republican congressmen blocked the appointment of Francis Ricciardone as ambassador to Turkey, because he is seen as ""too soft to deal with the Turkish government."" As a consequence, Turkish policymakers are planning to intensify contacts with Congress, after a series of talks in Washington between a high-level Turkish delegation and senior administration officials. The formation of an international commission under the auspices of the UN secretary-general to look into the events surrounding the flotilla incident was considered a victory for Turkish diplomacy and its results crucial for relations with Israel. But the US approach to the international commission focused on reconciling Israel and Turkey and proposing ""recommendations as to how to avoid such incidents in the future,"" a statement that angered Ankara. ISRAEL DECIDED on an independent public commission with international observers to examine the maritime incident. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, in his testimony before the commission declared that the tension with Turkey was Ankara's choice and left the door open for recovery.His surprising decision to cooperate with the UN commission also reflected an interest in maintaining good ties with Turkey. Turkey for its part decided on a national commission under the coordination of the Prime Minister's Office, with the participation of bureaucrats from the Foreign, Justice, Transportation and Interior ministries for investigating ""the treatment to which persons in the convoy had been exposed."" No word about its responsibilities in the incident. Moreover, Turkish prosecutors launched an investigation against top Israeli leaders, which could result in pressing charges of murder and assault on Turkish citizens on the high seas and piracy. Other negative Turkish moves included a meeting in mid-July between Davutoglu and Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal to discuss efforts to heal the rift between Hamas and Fatah. Hamas claimed the talks also covered Turkish efforts ""to break the Israeli embargo"" on Gaza. Israel's envoy to Turkey has not been invited lately to the annual Iftar dinner hosted by AKP for representatives of the diplomatic corps, an unprecedented hostile diplomatic act. The Italian daily Corriere della Sera reported that Turkish intelligence personnel and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards have recently signed an agreement to assist Hizbullah by transferring weapons from Iran to Syria and Lebanon through Turkey. The Turkish Foreign Ministry denied the report. The Turks were already infuriated by Defense Minister Ehud Barak's claim that the new head of Turkish intelligence, Hakan Fidan, was a ""friend of Iran"" and that military information provided to Turkey might be handed over to the Iranians. The Turkish opposition accused Erdogan of seeking a confrontation with Israel to advance his internal nationalist credentials before the September referendum and planning to advance the scheduled elections of July 2011. According to the Turkish daily Hurriyet, the ""Hamas-friendly"" AKP government ""cannot afford to give any impression to the public that it accepted anything short of an international inquiry that will ultimately find Israel guilty"" and unless a settlement is reached which enables both sides to save face ""matters will continue to get worse."" On September 12, Turkish voters will go to the polls to approve or reject ""revolutionary constitutional changes"" proposed by the AKP government, which are intended to consolidate its influence, particularly in the judiciary. If the AKP wins the referendum and thus continues to tighten its grip on the media, military and judiciary, it will persevere on the path of Islamization and the shunning of Israel. A sign in this direction is Turkey's reaction to the latest terrorist attacks in Israel intended to derail the peace negotiations in Washington. Turkey ""welcomed the resumption of direct talks between Israel and Palestine"" and stated that ""it was important to avoid unilateral acts which would negatively affect the process,"" but said nothing about the Hamas responsibility for the ""heroic"" murder of four innocent civilians last week.

263,Jerusalem Post,2010-10-29,The Scott Brown precedent and Israel,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,OPINION; Pg. 24,"February 22, 2011",1934 words,"On Tuesday, US voters are set to repudiate President Barak Obama's agenda for their country. Unfortunately, based on his behavior in the face of a similar repudiation last January, it is safe to assume that Obama will not abandon his course. Last year, in an attempt to block Obama's plan to nationalize healthcare, Massachusetts voters elected Republican Scott Brown to the Senate. Brown was elected because he pledged to block Obamacare in the US Senate. Rather than heed the voters' message and abandon his plans, Obama abandoned the voters. Instead of accepting his defeat, Obama changed the rules of the game and bypassed the Senate. So it is safe to assume that for the next two years, Obama will do everything he can to bypass Congress and govern by executive orders and regulations. Although much can be done in this fashion, Congress's control of the purse strings will check his domestic agenda. In matters of foreign policy, however, Obama will be less burdened by - but not immune - to congressional oversight. We can therefore expect him to devote far more energy to foreign affairs in the next two years than he devoted in the last two years. This bodes ill for Israel. Since entering office, Obama has shown that his primary foreign policy goal is to remake the US's relationship with the Muslim world. He has also repeatedly demonstrated that compelling Israel to make concessions to the Palestinians and empowering international institutions that seek to delegitimize Israel are his preferred means of advancing this goal. To date, Obama's demands on Israel have focused on blocking construction and delegitimizing Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria and Jewish neighborhoods in Jerusalem. And as far as he is concerned, Israel's response to his demands to date has been unsatisfactory. In light of this, at a minimum we can expect that in the immediate aftermath of next Tuesday's elections, Obama will deliberately provoke a new crisis in US relations with Israel over Jewish building in Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria. But of course, this isn't his only option. Indeed, he has nearly unlimited options for making life unpleasant for Israel. Obama doesn't even have to be the one to provoke the next crisis. He can simply take advantage of crises that the Palestinians provoke. THE PALESTINIANS are threatening to provoke two such crises in the next several months. First, Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas is threatening to ask the UN Security Council to pass a resolution declaring all Israeli communities beyond the 1949 armistice lines illegal and requiring the expulsion of the 450,000 Israeli Jews who live in them. Second, the PA's unelected Prime Minister Salam Fayyad is threatening to declare independence without a treaty with Israel next summer. Simply by not opposing these deeply aggressive initiatives against Israel, Obama can cause Israel enormous harm. Other outlets for pressure include stepping up harassment of pro-Israel groups in the US, holding up the transfer of arms to Israel, pressing for the IDF to end its counterterror operations in Judea and Samaria, and expanding US financial and military support for the Palestinian army. All of these moves will doubtless be employed to varying degrees in the next two years. This onslaught on Israel will be implemented against the backdrop of a dynamic regional strategic environment. The evolving threats that Israel faces include among other things, Iran's acquisition of a nuclear arsenal, and Iran's takeover of Lebanon, Gaza and Syria. Israel also faces the likelihood that instability and fanaticism will engulf Egypt after President Hosni Mubarak dies and that Jordan will be destabilized after US forces vacate Iraq. Over the next two years, Israel will be required to contend with these developing threats in profound ways. And over the next two years, all of Israel's actions aimed at mitigating these threats will need to be taken with the certain knowledge that the country will be in and out of crises with the Obama administration throughout. Whatever military actions Israel will be required to take will have to be timed to coincide with lulls in Obama-provoked crises. The one good thing about the challenge Obama presents to Israel is that it is a clear cut challenge. The Scott Brown precedent coupled with Obama's track record on Israel demonstrate that Obama will not modify his anti-Israel agenda to align with political realities at home, and there is nothing that Israel can do that will neutralize Obama's hostility. By the same token, the massive support Israel enjoys among the incoming Republican majority in the House of Representatives is a significant resource. True, the Republicans will not enjoy the same power to check presidential power in foreign affairs as they will have in domestic policy. But their control over the House of Representatives will enable them to shape public perceptions of international affairs and mitigate administration pressure on Israel by opening up new outlets for discourse and defunding administration initiatives. Against this backdrop, Israel must craft policies that maximize its advantage on Capitol Hill and minimize its vulnerability to the White House. Specifically, Israel should adopt three basic policy lines. First, Israel should request that US military assistance to the IDF be appropriated as part of the Defense Department's budget instead of the State Department's foreign aid budget where it is now allocated. This change is important for two reasons. First, US military assistance to Israel is not welfare. Like US military assistance to South Korea, which is part of the Pentagon's budget, US military assistance to Israel is a normal aspect of routine relations between the US and its strategic allies. Israel is one of the US's most important strategic allies and it should be treated like the US's other allies are treated and not placed in the same basket as impoverished states in Africa. Second, this move is supported by the Republicans. Rep. Eric Cantor, who will likely be elected Republican Majority Leader, has already stated his interest in moving military assistance to Israel to the Pentagon budget. The Republicans wish to move aid to Israel to the Pentagon's budget because that assistance is the most popular item on the US foreign aid budget. Not wishing to harm Israel, Republicans have been forced to approve the foreign aid budget despite the fact that it includes aid to countries like Sudan and Yemen that they do not wish to support. When the government announces its request, it should make clear that in light of Israel's economic prosperity, Israel intends to end its receipt of military assistance from the US within five years. Given the Republicans' commitment to fiscal responsibility, this is a politically sensible move. More importantly, it is a strategically critical move. Obama's hostility demonstrates clearly that Israel must not be dependent on US resupply of military platforms in time of war. The second policy direction Israel must adopt involves stepping up its efforts to discredit and check the Palestinian political war against it. Today the Palestinians are escalating their bid to delegitimize Israel by expanding their offensive against Israel in international organizations like the UN and the International Criminal Court and by expanding their operations in states like Britain that are hostile to Israel. Israel must move aggressively to discredit all groups and individuals that participate in these actions, and cooperate with its allies who share its aim of weakening them. For instance, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is expected to be elected chairwoman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, has been seeking to curtail US funding to UN organizations like UNRWA whose leaders support Hamas and whose organizational goal is Israel's destruction. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and his ministers must lead the charge discrediting groups like UNRWA, the ICC and the UN Human Rights Council. Since the Obama administration seeks to empower all of these organizations, at a minimum, such an Israeli policy will embolden Obama's political opponents to block his policies by curtailing US funding of these bodies. The Palestinians' threats to declare independence and define Israeli communities as illegal are clear attempts on their part to shape the post-peace process international landscape. Given their diplomatic strength and Israel's diplomatic weakness, it is reasonable for the Palestinians to act as they are. But two can play this game. ISRAEL IS not without options. These options are rooted in its military control on the ground, Netanyahu's political strength at home, and popular support for Israel in the US. Israel should prepare its own unilateral actions aimed at shaping the post-Oslo international agenda. It should implement these actions the moment the Palestinians carry through on their threats. For instance, the day the UN Security Council votes on a resolution to declare Israeli communities in Judea and Samaria and Israeli neighborhoods in Jerusalem illegal, Israel should announce it is applying Israeli law to either all of Judea and Samaria, or to the large Israeli population centers and to the Jordan Valley. If properly timed and orchestrated, such a move by Israel could fundamentally reshape the international discourse on the Middle East in Israel's favor. Certainly it will empower Israel's allies in the US and throughout the world to rally to its side. The challenge that Washington now poses to Israel is not unprecedented. Indeed for Netanyahu it is familiar. During his first tenure as prime minister, Netanyahu faced a similar predicament with the Clinton administration. In October 1998, then-president Bill Clinton was about to be impeached. The Republicans stood poised to expand their control over the House of Representatives. Paralyzed domestically, Clinton turned to Israel. He placed enormous pressure on Netanyahu to agree to further land concessions to Yasser Arafat in Judea and Samaria. In what became the Wye Memorandum, Clinton forced Netanyahu to agree to massive concessions in exchange for which Clinton agreed to free Jonathan Pollard from prison. At the time, Israel's allies in Washington enjoined Netanyahu not to succumb to Clinton's pressure. They argued that in his weakened state, Clinton had limited capacity to harm Netanyahu. Moreover, they warned that by caving to his pressure, Netanyahu would strengthen Clinton and guarantee that he would double down on Israel. In the event, Netanyahu spurned Israel's allies and bent to Clinton's will. For his part, Clinton reneged on his pledge to release Pollard. Netanyahu's rightist coalition partners were appalled by his behavior. They bolted his coalition in protest and his government fell. Rather than stand by Netanyahu for his concessions, Clinton and the Israeli Left joined hands to defeat him in the 1999 elections. The lesson Netanyahu learned from this experience was that he cannot trust the political Right to stand by him. While not unreasonable, this was not the main lesson from his experience. The larger point is that Netanyahu must not delude himself into believing that by falling into the arms of the Left he will win its support. The post-election Obama administration will make the lives of Israel's leaders unpleasant. But Netanyahu and his ministers are not powerless in the grip of circumstances. They have powerful allies and supporters in Washington and the confidence of the Israeli people. These are formidable assets. caroline@carolineglick.com"
264,The Guardian - Final Edition,2010-06-22,World briefing: Reality derails Turkey's foreign policy ambitions,,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,GUARDIAN INTERNATIONAL PAGES; Pg. 22,"June 22, 2010",659 words,"A surge in violence pitting Turkish forces against Kurdish separatists along Turkey's south-eastern border with Iraq has underscored how far the Ankara government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan still has to go in resolving the ""Kurdish question"". But the renewed fighting also poses a larger question: to what extent the policy espoused by Erdogan and his foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, of ""zero problems with neighbours"", is producing tangible results? On a range of fronts ambitions are colliding with intractable realities. Erdogan's fierce condemnation of the killing on Saturday of 11 soldiers by Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) fighters possibly reflected frustration that Ankara's pursuit of non-military solutions has produced little concrete in the eight years since his Justice and Development (AKP) party first came to power. ""Today we will not make the traitors happy,"" Erdogan said. ""We will defend this ground heroically . . . they will not win. They will gain nothing. They will melt away in their own darkness . . . they will drown in their own blood."" Such rhetoric could not disguise widely felt dismay that a conflict that has claimed about 40,000 lives since 1984 could be reviving, partly due to political failures. Citing continuing Turkish military attacks, the PKK announced this month it was ending a unilateral ceasefire. The decision followed the banning by Turkey's constitutional court of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society party, a ruling criticised by Massoud Barzani, president of Iraqi Kurdistan, and the EU. Concern is now growing that further clashes could lead to a repeat of the 2008 Turkish military incursion in north Iraq, the base of some PKK fighters. Such an outcome could strain Ankara's relations with Baghdad, where its efforts to encourage a role in government for Iraq's Sunni Muslim minority are viewed as meddling by some Shia politicians. Turkey's ""zero problems"" policy has also run into trouble around Azerbaijan's disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, where four ethnic Armenian and one Azeri soldier were killed in a skirmish on Saturday. Turkey and Armenia struck a peace accord last year but the deal backfired when Azerbaijan, a close ally of Turkey, angrily insisted the Nagorno-Karabakh stand-off be settled first. Instead of easing tensions, Erdogan's initiative inflamed them. Despite Turkey's aspirations to act as regional powerbroker, its talk has not been matched by persuasive actions in Cyprus. Turkish Cypriots have voted in a president who seems to favour permanent partition of the island. Erdogan has improved relations with Iran; his decision to vote against the latest UN sanctions on Tehran dismayed the US and Europe while delighting the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In contrast, relations with Israel are at a low ebb after the Gaza flotilla debacle. Erdogan's regional foreign policy initiatives, flirtation with Iran, split with Israel, and courting of supposedly suspect countries, like Syria, have led western commentators to speculate about a ""strategic realignment"" - away from the west and towards the Arab and Muslim worlds. ""Turkey's Islamist government (seems) focused not on joining the (EU) but the Arab League - no, scratch that, on joining the Hamas-Hezbollah-Iran resistance front against Israel,"" wrote American columnist Tom Friedman. Writing in The Australian, Greg Sheridan said: ""The Turkish government is expressing maximum outrage over the Gaza incident, although it has been vastly more brutal in suppressing Kurdish separatists . . . than anything Israel has ever dreamed of."" Strong criticism of the perceived shift has also been voiced in the US Congress. Davutoglu insists Turkey is ""playing an increasingly central role in promoting international security and prosperity"". From a western perspective the problem is not that Erdogan and Davutoglu want a bigger role for Turkey and are increasingly ready to go it alone; the problem is that when they do, they mess up."
265,The Guardian - Final Edition,2010-11-05,"G2: Who needs the military?: Our armed forces cannot meet the real threats to modern Britain. So why must we pay £45bn for something we don't require, asks Simon Jenkins",,,Newspaper,,,ENGLISH,GUARDIAN FEATURES PAGES; Pg. 4,"November 5, 2010",3115 words,"Six months ago I proposed in the Guardian that if Britain was short of money it should cut defence. I did not mean reduce defence, or trim defence. I meant cut it altogether. We are desperately short of money and absolutely no one is threatening to attack us now or in the foreseeable, indeed conceivable, future. Besides, as we have seen this past week, other ways of ensuring security make more pressing claims on us. We just do not need an army, navy or air force. So why are we paying £45bn for them? I am not a pacifist. I accept the need to fight to protect my home, hearth and nation and, in extremis, to uphold some concept of global civilisation against an all-consuming tyrant. I grew up accepting the danger of a nuclear war exchange as real; I was never a member of CND. Nonetheless, it stands to reason that all public expenditure must justify its claim on the taxpayer, especially one such as defence that is essentially precautionary. Defence is an insurance premium, a massive one. But it cannot merely be asserted as necessary, and left to professionals to fix the premium. Thirteen years ago, I had my defence epiphany on the lay committee for Labour's first and only strategic defence review in 1997. This was under George Robertson. I vividly remember our first meeting when we were given our terms of reference. Such was the radical mood of those euphoric early Blair days that were told to think the unthinkable and discuss everything, no holds barred. This lasted about five minutes. It turned out we could not discuss the nuclear deterrent; we could not question the Trident programme and its submarines; we could not discuss the Eurofighter contract; nor could we discuss the need for two or perhaps three new aircraft carriers. I remember the smug look on the faces of service chiefs in the room. Our excluded items had nothing really to do with Britain's defence. They were political. Robertson and his colleagues were under instructions not to give an inch to the Tories on defence procurement, lest they be seen as soft on defence. We could think the unthinkable - but not the thinkable. Only later did I realise that review laid the groundwork for a decade of indiscipline and budgetary chaos. Nothing was related to strategy, let alone foreign policy. Each service ordered what its favourite supplier made, and then kept redesigning it. Some hapless future government would pay, even if it was no longer needed. I was intrigued this year to see the MoD ask that the cost of Trident be shifted from the defence budget to the Treasury on the grounds that the deterrent had nothing to do with defence. The outcome is what David Cameron has called a car crash of a defence budget. Anyone who takes taxes from others should be obliged to say why. In the case of most public spending, the answer is easy. It is to buy a school, hospital, road, care home or welfare benefit. In the realm of overall security I am glad money is spent on the police and the intelligence services. I accept the need for some monitoring of borders and airspace and coastline. I also accept the need for some territorial reserve, for instance to assist in civil emergencies and in UN operations. Some taxes are an insurance against future risk, such as being ill or having a sick relative. But they are usually subject to some actuarial assessment of the risk. Defence spending is insurance of a different order. We make no actuarial calculation of the risk of British citizens dying in a military attack or of British property being destroyed. Yet we are required to part with a premium of £45bn a year to prevent it. Why? Two weeks ago the coalition government bravely tried to answer this question. It published a list of threats to Britain's security in what I must say is one of the most bizarre documents to emerge from the ectoplasm of the MoD. It was a paranoid's manifesto, a Matrix movie horror. Admittedly, the authors had a tough job. There is no Wehrmacht hovering across the Channel, no Napoleonic Grande Armee massing at Calais and no megaton missile with itchy communist fingers pointing at Britain. So how on earth were they to justify £45bn? They decided, in their tidy way, to group various so-called threats into three tiers of seriousness. The first tier contains four threats, like a Russian doll. Number one, presumably the greatest, is ""attacks on British cyberspace by states and cyber-criminals"". The second is international terrorism. The third is a ""military crisis"" between other states, one that ""draws in"" Britain. The last is ""a major accident or natural hazard that requires a national response,"" such as coastal flooding or flu. The second tier of threats comprise ""an attack from another state using chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons"". Next come ""instability, insurgency or civil war overseas,"" that affect us by somehow ""creating an environment that terrorists can exploit to threaten Britain"". In other words terrorism again. Next is a big rise in organised crime. Next is ""severe disruption to satellite-based information, possibly deliberate from another state"". This is a repeat of the cyberspace threat. Lastly we have the third tier of threats, the least serious. The first is ""a large-scale conventional military attack on Britain"" by an unspecified other state. The second, somewhat desperately, is terrorism again, the third is crime again. The authors clearly ran out of threats, but had to fill their threat quota. We are also threatened by immigrants and smugglers ""trying to cross the UK border"". We are ""threatened"" by an accident at a nuclear site; by a conventional attack on a Nato ally, and by an attack on a British colony. Finally, we face a curious bundle of threats: fuel shortages, price instability, and ""a short- to medium-term disruption to international supplies or resources"". You may note that almost none of the above is a threat. They are crimes and catastrophes or, in the case of being ""drawn in"" to a foreign conflict, a matter of political choice. Many things on the list may make me feel a bit uncomfortable, but few are remotely to do with the security of the state. They are incoherent and repetitive and rather desperate, like a madman with a sandwich board crying, ""They are coming to get you; the end is nigh!"" Yet this list was the basis for last month's strategic defence review with its £45bn price tag. A set of threats that are almost entirely non-military is to be met by submarines carrying nuclear missiles, two new aircraft carriers and dozens of jet fighters. Let's start with the threat of a nuclear missile landing on Britain. I have seen no analysis of how this might emerge from the existing international order, and certainly no explanation of how nuclear deterrence might apply in any specific case. In the barely conceivable eventuality of Iran or some such hostile state building a bomb, buying a missile capable of reaching Britain and then firing it, the act would be so lunatic as to be beyond any plausible deterrence. You cannot deter a suicidal nation any more than you can a suicidal bomber. Small wonder defence chiefs wanted their nuclear missile reclassified as ""political"". As for using this precious weapon to deter a conventional attack, that is surely no less fanciful. Britain's possession of nuclear missiles has had no deterrent value in any of the dozen wars it has fought in half a century. Did we threaten Argentina with it? No. Yet time and again military strategists refer to it as a useful ""reserve capability"". When a soldier resorts to abstract nouns you know he has lost the argument. As for the threat of a conventional attack on the British Isles by another state, we can only ask, who? The threat is so negligible as to be insignificant. It is like insuring one's house for billions of pounds against an asteroid attack. Is the attack to come from Russia, or France, or Germany, or Ireland? Defence pundits to whom I put this crucial question look down their noses, as if it were impertinent or undergraduate. They murmur that one can never know. Yet the political preconditions for a conventional attack on Britain are so distant - the review relegates it to tier three - that Britain would have some notice and time to re-arm, as we did with remarkable speed when last so confronted in 1940. By jumbling together accidents, diseases, natural disasters and crimes as ""threats"", the government undermines its own plausibility. The defence lobby is trying to hijack the jobs of the police, civil rescue and medical professions. In the case of ""price instability"", it even wants to hijack the Financial Services Authority. These are not ""threats to national security"" against which we expect the defence ministry to plan or assemble conventional forces. The same applies to the threat which the MoD has struggled for decades to make its own, that of international terrorism. The threat review is so keen that it lists it no fewer than three times. It implies a requirement to deploy conventional forces against terrorists, who might be acting as ""proxy"" for a state. But there is a difference between a state that wants to overpower, conquer and rule us - a ludicrous threat of no serious concern - and one that merely wants to make a nuisance in the hope of achieving some lesser goal, such as getting Britain out of Northern Ireland or making Israel into a pariah. The latter certainly has applied, but if we were to deploy conventional forces against such a state we might, over the last quarter century, have declared war on Libya, Syria, Iran, the Irish Republic and even the state of Massachusetts. We did not. We treated an act of terror rightly as a methodology, a criminal means, not a political end. As Joseph Conrad said in The Secret Agent, the terrorist was a pest walking the street alone. His is a local and specific form of violence, causing mayhem in the hope of spreading panic and changing a state's behaviour in response to it. Terrorism has no political content unless awarded one by the victim nation. With the IRA and the PLO in the 1970s, the authorities played down the political significance of any outrage. Prisoners were treated as criminals and denied political status. The most limited coverage was given to their demands. Now we do the opposite. We play up the politics. I remember the admirable response to 9/11 by New York mayor Rudy Giuliani. He told New Yorkers on the day of the attack to go about their business as usual, use the park, go to a show, buy a pizza, keep working and, above all, keep spending. The trouble was, 9/11 was so awful an incident as to apparently transform a terrorist outrage into an apparent state of war, and thus admit it within the ambit of conventional defence. Nobody took any notice of what Giuliani said. They did what al-Qaida wanted, which was indulge in mass hysteria. Blair said the rules of the international game had changed - an astonishing accolade to Osama bin Laden. This cannot be unconnected with the fact that a politician's poll rating soars in the aftermath of a terrorist incident. Nothing helped George Bush more than 9/11. Politicians rush to the cameras, dive into bunkers and warn of threats to civilisation as we know it. Conventional military forces are put on alert. Blair once rushed tanks to Heathrow in a madcap gesture of self-importance. We invaded Afghanistan for harbouring terrorists. We invaded Iraq on the thesis that it might do so. Do we now invade Pakistan and Yemen on the same basis? Far from being deterred, terrorists and their sponsors clearly derive prestige and political clout when conventional forces are ranged against them. We thereby put them on the pedestal of state threat. By infringing our liberties and curbing our freedoms in their honour we let them win battles. By being publicly scared, as of this week's parcel bombs, we invite them to scare us some more. Such an approach to defence is not just wasteful but counter-productive. Politicians from Blair to Cameron declare the aim of war in Iraq and Afghanistan is to make the streets of Britain safer. There is not an iota of evidence for this extraordinary claim. Most analysts, including former security chiefs in the House of Lords, say the precise opposite. These wars have made us less safe, by making Britain a prime target for terrorists and breeding homegrown terrorists in schools, colleges and mosques. Watching Gordon Brown in Helmand mouthing nonsense about boys dying for safer streets was painful. He clearly did not believe it. So what of the other most common cause of Britain going to war, the threat of being ""drawn into"" someone else's squabble? First, this is not a threat but a political choice. These wars are nowadays called wars of choice. They are always beguiling. What you have, you are induced to deploy, often for the vaguest of purposes, such as ""making the world a better place"". The navy cites the need to stop pirates in the Indian Ocean and drug-runners in the Caribbean. Blair contributed British forces to six separate conflicts in his time in office, in Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and two each in Iraq and the former Yugoslavia. None was in response to a threat to the security of the British state. They were adjuncts to his foreign policy goal of ""hugging close"" to Washington. Armies with nothing to do tend to distort the purpose for which they were formed. They become institutionalised. They coalesce into a wide constituency of veterans, territorial and political supporters, above all, equipment suppliers. As with terrorism, so with the government's other listed threats, we should ponder those who leap forward to publicise them. Whenever the BBC calls in a ""security expert"" to comment on the awfulness of some new threat, we should be told for whom he works. Remember Deep Throat's maxim, follow the money? Being ""drawn in"" is the phraseology of the security review. But note the intransitive. Drawn in by whom? In whose interests, or on whose behalf, are we spending billions of pounds killing thousands of people in the Muslim world just now? Shouldn't we also have been ""drawn in"" to Rwanda, Darfur, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Burma? In each case, man's inhumanity to man has been more gross than in Iraq and Afghanistan. We did nothing. From the earliest enunciation of liberal interventionism, it has been wanting in rigour. In 1999, Blair spoke in Chicago in favour of humanitarian ""just"" wars, as if they carried with them their own validation. All they carried was a clutter of moral superiority. I do not regard Germans or Japanese or Indians or Brazilians as lacking in moral fibre for not fighting alongside us in Blair's wars. I find nothing peculiarly moral, first in helping the break up of former Yugoslavia, then the break up of Serbia and now the devastation of Iraq and Afghanistan. We are left with what I call the ontological argument for defences spending. It exists and therefore it is. It is the ultimate security, to which no concept of proportion can apply. We protect ourselves out of instinct. Like spending on health, you just cannot get enough of it. It is a response not to known threats (such as Russia), nor even to known unknowns (such as a resurgent Russia), but to those famous unknown unknowns. The great ontologist, Donald Rumsfeld, remains the patron saint of defence expenditure. The argument can take amazing forms. Come now, say the high priests. Just suppose another Hitler rose again, built a new Luftwaffe and U-boats, and bombed London and sank all our coastal trade. We would need a carrier. Suppose Russia falls under the sway of an oligarch with a grudge against Harrods and a business rival in Kensington Palace Gardens. Suppose he decides to nuke them. Supposed 100 suicide bombers block-booked themselves on Eurostar and went to every Premier League match. You would look pretty silly, Jenkins, wouldn't you? I would look pretty silly, and probably I wouldn't be the only one. But for the time being, I regard such unrealities used to justify massive spending as no less silly. We can only meet realistic threats. We do not build 1,000 NHS hospitals and leave them to await the return of bubonic plague. Britain as a sovereign stae is less ""under threat"" today than ever in my life, indeed less than ever in its existence. That is to the credit of recent generations of British governments. But this means we do not need a defence that has been successfully rendered obsolete. The chief threat to me today, if at all, is from crime. Yet we are appalling at combating it. Obsessed with punishment, we neglect crime prevention. To guard me from unreal foreign attack the government spends £45bn, but to guard my home and hearth from crime it spends just £6.4bn, and badly. I am defended against crime, including terrorist attack, not by an army, navy or air force, but by vigilant acquaintances of the criminals, by an alert school and mosque, by the police and by the apparatus of intelligence, espionage and diplomacy. The truth of the matter is that our defence spending is misdirected and extravagantly out of date. We are re-equipping for Agincourt on the brink of Waterloo. We are laying down long boats for the battle of the Atlantic. We are deploying cold-war weapons against occasional outrages by fanatics with no capacity to cause the state harm. I sometimes wonder why I see things this way, when so few others do. I am a pragmatist, not a pacifist. But I respect language, and am suspicious of the vapid cliches about national interest, punching our weight, sitting at top tables and being respected. I hate to see terrorism, a miserable perversion, accorded the accolade of grand enemy of the state. I hate to see statesmen whose job is to keep threats out of sight and mind exploiting the politics of fear. The fault lies partly in the sloppy language used to discuss defence, which loses all ability to convey risk and proportion and slides into sloppy nouns and sloppy thinking. At that point, leaders lose touch with democracy, a serious threat to the security of any state. The only defence against that danger lies not in armies, bombs and guns, but solely in the deployment of meticulous reason.

Bush at the helm of American leadership.The Great Recession which saw a rise in unemployment and bankruptcies in the US was overwhelming. Although the Obama administration has been able to face these difficulties, it has not been able to make an impressive dent into the state of malaise that is rocking the country.Even its success in securing, solely on party lines, a new healthcare programme, the two versions approved by the House of Representatives and the Senate, have yet to be reconciled in the months ahead - a very difficult hurdle.In foreign affairs, the year-old Obama administration has not had much success. If anything, it has yet to bring the US troops home from Iraq where they have been serving longer than their fellow countrymen during World War II.Its attempt at settling various international problems, such as the Arab-Israeli conflict which contributes to the state of insecurity and terror in many regions including the United States, has not been remarkable.""President Obama's freshman-year foreign policy was the worst in living memory,"" editorialised, as expected, The Washington Times, a right-wing pro-Republican newspaper.""At the dawn of 2010, the United States finds itself noticeably weaker in international affairs than it was when Mr Obama took office, and there are no signs of improvement in the year ahead.""The paper acknowledged that Bush ""was not loved, but he was feared, which Machiavelli advises is amore durable position,"" while Obama ""has sought only to be loved ...""His performance at the beginning of 2009 was strongly approved by 43 per cent of Americans but at the end of 2009 the number dropped to only 26 per cent.""In foreign policy,"" wrote Richard Cohen of The Washington Post, ""Obama has sorely disappointed his fans on the left for escalating the war in Afghanistan and on the right for not escalating it enough. Guantanamo, which he vowed to close, is still open.""His Republican criticisms began to stick, according to Cohen, a liberal columnist, because ""Obama can be made into anything his critics want"" .He elaborated that Obama is ""a lean man of ideological clay who has let others mould his image. His bottom line is forever on the move. It's not that he's not good or smart, it's rather that in a political universe ruled by political yellers, he lacks both an ideology and the pipes."" The president's ""misfortune is to be a leader without a cause"".What is sorely missing from the American body politic is the constant failure to realise that if Obama, or any American president, were for example to champion a fair settlement between Israelis and the Palestinians (and Syria and Lebanon), it will rob many recruiters similar to those who handled the Detroit passenger from Nigeria who almost managed to blow up his plane on Christmas Day.Regrettably, this incident has led the Obama administration to revive racial profiling whereby anyone travelling from or though nations regarded as state sponsors of terrorism - as well as ""other countries of interest"" - will be subjected to enhanced screening. The majority of these states are Arab and Muslim.There is, for example, no explanation in the media or Congress of why the US allows Israel to get away with murder.Take the case of its invasion of the Gaza Strip a year ago when 1,400 Palestinians, many of them women and children, were killed. The densely populated region with a population of about 1.3 million, remains under siege, partially with the unbelievable assistance of Egypt which controls Gaza's southern border, denying inhabitants much needed food and medical supplies that can be smuggled through tunnels. (Egypt is now planning to seal the border with an underground wall).Meantime, American officials, like Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, continue to make platitudinous remarks before the press as she did when she met the visiting Qatari prime minister in Washington: ""We both have a shared mutual interest in moving towards a comprehensive peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. We both share the goal of an independent and viable Palestinian state, and we are committed to doing what we can to help relaunch peace negotiations that would lead to a two-state solution. We believe that President Abbas is a partner for peace and can help deliver that to the Palestinian people.""What is needed here is more action thanwords by the Obama administration.
